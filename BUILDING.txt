How to build VirtualGL in 9043 easy steps
=========================================


*******************************************************************************
**     Prerequisites - Linux
*******************************************************************************

-- OpenSSL headers and link libraries

   VirtualGL can be built using the shared OpenSSL libraries provided with
   your Linux distribution, but this produces a version of VirtualGL that is
   not compatible with other Linux distributions.  In order to build a fully
   cross-compatible version of VirtualGL, install the openssl-static package,
   which can be obtained from the "Download" area of:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

   The direct link for openssl-static downloads is:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=221619

   There are three versions of the openssl-static package:  a 32-bit package
   for GLIBC 2.2 systems (such as RedHat 7.x and Enterprise Linux 2.1) and both
   32-bit and 32/64-bit packages for GLIBC 2.3 (and later) systems.  These
   packages are provided in both RPM and tarball formats.  You can use alien
   (http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/) to convert the tarballs into DEB
   packages, if you prefer.

-- GCC and G++

-- X11 dev. kit

   On most Linux variants, this can be found in the "XFree86-devel" or 
   "xorg-x11-devel" package.

-- GNU Make v3.7 or later

-- binutils 2.12.90 or later.  This shouldn't be an issue unless you are
   (still) running RedHat 7.x or Enterprise Linux 2.1, in which case you can
   download an updated binutils RPM from:
   http://mirror.atrpms.net/ccrma/mirror/7.2/

-- TurboJPEG SDK

   The TurboJPEG SDK Linux packages (in RPM or tarball format) can be obtained
   from the "Download" area of:

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

   The direct link for TurboJPEG downloads is:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

   Use the i386 package for 32-bit systems and the x86_64 package for 64-bit
   systems (the x86_64 package contains both 64-bit and 32-bit libraries.)
   You can use alien (http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/) to convert the
   tarballs into DEB packages, if you prefer.


*******************************************************************************
**     Prerequisites - x86-64 Linux
*******************************************************************************

Building a redistributable VirtualGL package for x86-64 requires building both
32-bit and 64-bit versions of the VirtualGL server components.  But not all
x86-64 Linux systems contain the 32-bit libraries necessary to build a 32-bit
version of VirtualGL.  To build 32-bit VirtualGL components on an x86-64 Linux
system, you will need, at minimum, the following 32-bit libraries:

-- glibc development libraries

   * Usually contained in the "glibc-devel" package (iX86)
   * Usually installed by default on x86-64 Linux systems

-- X11 dev. kit

   * Usually contained in the "XFree86-devel" or "xorg-x11-devel" package
     (iX86)
   * Not always installed by default but usually available on the installation
     discs

If for some reason your preferred 64-bit Linux distribution does not contain
one or more of the above, then:

  1.  Complain to your distribution vendor.
  2.  All x86-64 distributions of Linux have a corresponding 32-bit-only
      distribution, usually released on a separate set of discs.  On those
      discs, you should be able to find the 32-bit versions of the X11 dev. kit
      and the GLIBC dev. kit to match the 64-bit versions that are already
      installed on your system. You may have to use "rpm --force" (or a similar
      mechanism) to force the install of the 32-bit development packages, since
      they might contain header files which conflict with the 64-bit
      development packages that are already installed.  Again, complain to your
      distribution vendor.


*******************************************************************************
**     Prerequisites - Mac
*******************************************************************************

-- Xcode Tools
   * Available on the OS X install discs or from:
     http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode
   * At minimum, you will need the following packages from Xcode:
     gcc v3 or above
     X11 SDK
     OpenGL SDK
     Mac OS X SDK

-- TurboJPEG SDK (Intel-based Macs only)

   * The TurboJPEG SDK disk image (DMG) can be obtained from the "Download"
     area of:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

     The direct link for TurboJPEG downloads is:

     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

   * Open the DMG file and double-click on the package inside to install
     TurboJPEG.

-- Quicktime and CoreAudio SDK's (PowerPC-based Macs only)


*******************************************************************************
**     Prerequisites - Solaris
*******************************************************************************

-- Solaris 8 or newer (Sparc) or Solaris/OpenSolaris 10 or newer (x86)

-- OpenSSL headers and link libraries

   VirtualGL can be built using the shared OpenSSL libraries provided with
   Solaris 10 and later, but this produces a version of VirtualGL that is not
   compatible with earlier versions of Solaris.  In order to build a fully
   backward-compatible version of VirtualGL, download and install the latest
   OpenSSL package from Blastwave (http://www.blastwave.org).

-- Sun Studio/Workshop Pro Compiler

   * Tested with v5.5 (Sparc) and with Sun Studio 10, 11, & 12 (Sparc and x86)
   * See http://www.sun.com/software/products/studio/ for a free download.

... or ...

-- GCC

   * Preferred version:
     http://cooltools.sunsource.net/gcc/4.0.3/install.html
     Also available from the Solaris 9 & 10 Companion CD's
     (http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/),
     Blastwave (http://www.blastwave.org), or SunFreeware
     (http://www.sunfreeware.com/)
   * Build VirtualGL using
       gmake CC=gcc

-- SOLARIS 8 ONLY:  Linker patch 109147-32 must be installed

   * See http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patchpage

-- SPARC ONLY:  Sun OpenGL

   * Requires v1.3 or later (1.5 or later recommended)
   * See http://www.sun.com/software/graphics/opengl/
   * If your build system has Sun OpenGL v1.3, build VirtualGL using
       gmake USEGLP=no

-- GNU Make v3.7 or later

   * Available from the Solaris 9 & 10 Companion CD's
     (http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/),
     Blastwave (http://www.blastwave.org), or SunFreeware
     (http://www.sunfreeware.com/)

-- Sun mediaLib  [recommended]

   * VirtualGL includes a version of libjpeg v6b which will produce correct,
     albeit slow, behavior.  In order to get optimal performance out of
     VirtualGL on Solaris, it is necessary to use the mediaLib codec, which is
     capable of compressing JPEG images 3-4x faster than libjpeg.
   * mediaLib is pre-installed on Solaris 10.  It can also be downloaded for
     free from http://www.sun.com/processors/vis/mlib.html.  Solaris 10/x86
     users should upgrade the pre-installed version of mediaLib on their
     system to mediaLib 2.5 in order to achieve better performance.


*******************************************************************************
**     Prerequisites - Win32
*******************************************************************************

These prerequisites are for building a native Windows client.  For building
VirtualGL on Cygwin, see the next section.

-- GNU Make v3.7 or later

   GNU Make for Win32 can be found in MSYS
   (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml) or Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later

   * Tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and
     Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (both free downloads):

     http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

   * Add the compiler binary directories (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN;
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE)
     to the system or user PATH environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.
   * Add the compiler include directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\INCLUDE)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.
   * Add the compiler library directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\LIB)
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.

-- Microsoft Windows SDK

   * This is included with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, but users
     of prior editions of Visual C++ can download the SDK from:

     http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx

   * Add the SDK binary directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\bin)
     to the system or user PATH environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.
   * Add the SDK include directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\include)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.
   * Add the SDK library directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\lib)
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.

-- OpenSSL headers and link libraries

   * Download the latest Win32 OpenSSL installer from:

     http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

   * Install it into c:\openssl.
   * Add c:\openssl\include to the system or user INCLUDE environment
     variable prior to building VirtualGL.
   * Add c:\openssl\lib\VC\static to the system or user LIB environment
     variable prior to building VirtualGL.
   * If you are using OpenSSL 0.9.8h and Visual C++ 2008 or later to build
     VirtualGL, then comment out the following lines in
     c:\openssl\include\openssl\ossl_typ.h prior to building VirtualGL:

     typedef struct ocsp_req_ctx_st OCSP_REQ_CTX;
     typedef struct ocsp_response_st OCSP_RESPONSE;
     typedef struct ocsp_responder_id_st OCSP_RESPID;

     Hopefully this will be fixed in later releases of OpenSSL.

-- Hummingbird Exceed XDK v8 or later

   * Add the XDK include path (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Hummingbird\Connectivity\13.00\Exceed\XDK\include)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.
   * Add the XDK library path (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Hummingbird\Connectivity\13.00\Exceed\XDK\lib)
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     VirtualGL.

-- TurboJPEG SDK

   * The TurboJPEG SDK Windows installer (EXE) can be obtained from the
     "Download" area of:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

     The direct link for TurboJPEG downloads is:

     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

   * Add the TurboJPEG include path (c:\turbojpeg\include) to the system
     or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building VirtualGL.
   * Add the TurboJPEG library path (c:\turbojpeg\lib) to the system
     or user LIB environment variable prior to building VirtualGL.


*******************************************************************************
**     Building VirtualGL on Cygwin
*******************************************************************************

You should be able to build and run the VirtualGL client on Cygwin, although
this configuration has not been thoroughly tested.  To build VirtualGL on
Cygwin:

-- Install the following Cygwin packages if they aren't already installed:
   gcc
   gcc-core
   gcc-g++
   make
   openssl-devel
   xorg-x11-devel

-- Download and install the TurboJPEG SDK

   * The TurboJPEG SDK Windows installer (EXE) can be obtained from the
     "Download" area of:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

     The direct link for TurboJPEG downloads is:

     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

   * Add the TurboJPEG include path (/cygdrive/c/turbojpeg/include) to the
     CPATH environment variable prior to building VirtualGL.
   * Add the TurboJPEG library path (/cygdrive/c/turbojpeg/lib) to the
     LIBRARY_PATH environment variable prior to building VirtualGL.

-- Pass an argument of "platform=cygwin" to make when performing the
   build:

     make platform=cygwin

   The binaries will reside in "cygwin/bin" and "cygwin/lib".


*******************************************************************************
**     Building
*******************************************************************************

Assuming all of the above is set up correctly, you should be able to just type

  make

On Solaris, type

  gmake

instead.


*******************************************************************************
**     Makefile Options
*******************************************************************************

Each of these options can be passed as an argument to "make" or "gmake".  You
can also create a file called "config" in the root of the VirtualGL build
directory and add Makefile options to that file so as to avoid having to type
them every time you build VirtualGL.

DEBUG = yes

  * Build a version of VirtualGL with debugging symbols and no optimization.
    The debug version will reside in "${platform}/dbg/lib" and
    "${platform}/dbg/bin", whereas the release version will reside in
    "${platform}/lib" and "${platform}/bin", so these two versions can be built
    independently of one another.

JPEGLIB = libjpeg

  * The default build of VirtualGL links against the TurboJPEG SDK, which
    embeds highly accelerated JPEG coding routines from the Intel(R) Integrated
    Performance Primitives or Sun mediaLib.  TurboJPEG enables VirtualGL to
    compress full-screen images at interactive frame rates, but it relies upon
    closed source components to achieve this.  The use of these closed source
    components does not limit your ability to use and distribute VirtualGL
    in any way, but some may still wish to build a 100% open source version
    of VirtualGL.  Thus, specifying this Makefile option will build an
    (included) version of libjpeg and link VirtualGL against it rather than the
    accelerated TurboJPEG codecs mentioned above.  The use of libjpeg produces
    correct, albeit slow, behavior.  The version of libjpeg included in the
    VirtualGL build resides in the "jpeg/jpeg-6b" directory and differs
    from the IJG release (see http://www.ijg.org) only in its support of little
    endian and 32-bit pixel formats (both of which are necessary to allow
    the VirtualGL client to decompress directly into X11 shared memory.)

M32 = yes

  * On x86-64 systems, this cross-compiles a 32-bit (x86) version of VirtualGL.

CC = gcc

  * On Solaris, this builds VirtualGL using the GCC compiler rather than the
    default (Sun Studio) compiler.  gcc and g++ should be in your PATH.

USEGLP = no

  * On Solaris, this builds VirtualGL without GLP extension code.  This is 
    necessary to build VirtualGL on versions of Sun OpenGL prior to 1.5.

USESSL = no

  * Build VirtualGL without SSL support.


*******************************************************************************
**     Installing / Distributing
*******************************************************************************

On Unix systems, you can type

  make install [prefix={install prefix}]

"prefix" defaults to "/usr/local" but can be changed to something else (such
as "/usr") if you prefer.  Executables will be installed to "$prefix/bin", and
libraries will be installed to "$prefix/lib" (or "$prefix/lib/64" or
"$prefix/lib64", as appropriate.)

To build a redistributable package, type

  make dist

  * On Linux, this requires RPM v4 or later.
  * On Solaris, this requires pkgmk, pkgtrans, and bzip2.
  * On Windows, this requires the Nullsoft Install System
    (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/.)  makensis.exe should be in your PATH.
  * On OS X, this requires the PackageMaker application, which must be
    installed in Applications/Utilities.
