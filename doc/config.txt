** Server Settings

You can control the operation of the VirtualGL faker in four different ways.
Each method of configuration takes precedence over the previous method:

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable globally (for instance, in
		''/etc/profile'')

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable on a per-user basis (for instance, in
		''~/.bashrc'')

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable only for the current shell
		session (for instance, ''export VGL_XXX={whatever}'')

	#. Passing a configuration option as an argument to ''vglrun''.  This
		effectively overrides any previous environment variable setting
		corresponding to that configuration option.

|| Environment Variable Name \
	|| ''vglrun'' Command-Line Override || Description || Default Value ||
| ''VGL_CLIENT'' | ''-cl <client''{nl}''display>'' \
	| __The X display where VirtualGL should send its image stream__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		When running in Direct Mode, VirtualGL uses a dedicated TCP/IP connection \
		to transmit compressed images of an application's OpenGL rendering area \
		from the VirtualGL server to the VirtualGL client.  Thus, the VirtualGL server \
		needs to know on which machine the VirtualGL client software is running, \
		and it needs to know which X display on that machine will be used to draw \
		the application's GUI.  VirtualGL can normally surmise this by reading \
		the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable (which lists the hostname and X \
		display where all X11 traffic will be sent.)  But in cases \
		where X11 traffic is tunneled through SSh or another type of \
		indirect X11 connection, the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable on the \
		VirtualGL server may not point to the client machine.  In these cases, \
		set ''VGL_CLIENT'' to the display where the application's GUI will end \
		up.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export VGL_CLIENT=my_client:0.0'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If you are connecting to the VirtualGL server using SSh with X11 forwarding \
		enabled, VirtualGL will try to guess an appropriate value for ''VGL_CLIENT'' \
		based on the IP address of the SSh client, so you would only need to set \
		''VGL_CLIENT'' in this case if your configuration is unusual (such as if \
		your client machine's X server is occupying a display number other than 0 \
		or if you are trying to forward VirtualGL's image stream over SSh.  See \
		{ref prefix="Chapter ": Direct_Mode_Usage} for more details.) \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__** This option has no effect in "Raw" Mode. **__ \
	|	If SSh X11 forwarding is being used, VirtualGL will automatically set \
		''VGL_CLIENT'' to ''{ssh_client}:0.0'', where ''{ssh_client}'' is the IP \
		address of the machine from which the SSh connection was initiated. \
		Otherwise, ''VGL_CLIENT'' is unset, which tells VirtualGL to read the \
		client hostname and X display from the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable \
		instead. \
	|
| ''VGL_COMPRESS=0''{nl}''VGL_COMPRESS=1'' | ''-c <0, 1>'' \
	| __0 = Raw Mode (send rendered images uncompressed via. X11),__{nl} \
		__1 = Direct Mode (compress rendered images as JPEG & send on a separate \
			socket)__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		When this option is set to 0, VirtualGL will bypass its internal image \
		compression pipeline and instead use ''XPutImage()'' to composite the \
		rendered 3D images into the appropriate application window.  This mode \
		("Raw Mode") is primarily useful in conjunction with VNC, NX, or other \
		remote display software that performs X11 rendering on the server and \
		uses its own mechanism for compressing and transporting images to the \
		client.  Enabling Raw Mode on a remote X11 connection will result in \
		uncompressed images being sent over the network, so it is unadvisable \
		except on very fast networks (see {ref prefix="Section ": Raw_Mode_Over_Network}.) \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If this option is not specified, then VirtualGL's default behavior is to \
		use Direct Mode when the application is being displayed to a remote X \
		server and to use Raw Mode otherwise.  VirtualGL assumes that if the \
		''DISPLAY'' environment variable begins with a colon or with "''unix:''" \
		(example: "'':0.0''", "''unix:1000.0''", etc.), then the X11 connection is \
		local and thus doesn't require image compression.  Otherwise, it assumes \
		that the X11 connection is remote and that compression is required.  If \
		the display string begins with "''localhost''" or with the server's \
		hostname, VGL assumes that the display is being tunneled through SSh, and \
		its default behavior is to use Direct Mode in this case. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		It is normally not necessary to set this configuration parameter unless \
		you want to do something unusual (such as use Raw Mode over a remote X11 \
		connection.) See {ref prefix="Chapter ": TurboVNC_Usage} for more details. \
		{nl}{nl} \

	| __The display or GLP device to use for 3D rendering__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If your server has multiple 3D graphics cards and you want the OpenGL \
		rendering to be redirected to a display other than :0, set \
		''VGL_DISPLAY=:1.0'' or whatever.  This could be used, for instance, \
		to support many application instances on a beefy multi-pipe graphics \
		server. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__GLP mode (Solaris/Sparc only):__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Setting this option to ''glp'' will enable GLP mode and use the first \
		framebuffer device listed in ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' to \
		perform 3D rendering.  You can also set this option to the \
		pathname of a specific GLP device (example: ''/dev/fbs/jfb0''.)  See \
		{ref prefix="Section ": GLP_Usage} for more details. \

		{nl}{nl} \
		Setting ''VGL_FPS'' or passing ''-fps'' as an argument to ''vglrun'' will \
		enable VirtualGL's frame rate governor.  When enabled, the frame rate \
		governor will attempt to limit the overall throughput of the VirtualGL \
		pipeline to the specified number of frames/second.  If frame spoiling is \
		disabled, this effectively limits the server's 3D rendering frame rate as \
		well.  This option works regardless of whether VirtualGL is being run \
		in Direct Mode (with compression enabled) or in Raw Mode (with \
		compression disabled.) \

	| "Gamma" refers to the relationship between the intensity of light which \
		your computer's monitor is instructed to display and the intensity which \
		it actually displays.  The curve is an exponential curve of the form \
		__Y = X{^G}__, where X is between 0 and 1.  G is called the "gamma" of the \
		monitor.  PC monitors and TV's usually have a gamma of around 2.2. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Some of the math involved in 3D rendering assumes a linear gamma \
		(G = 1.0), so technically speaking, 3D applications will not display with \
		mathematical correctness unless the pixels are "gamma corrected" to \
		counterbalance the non-linear response curve of the monitor.  But some \
		systems do not have any form of built-in gamma correction, and thus the \
		applications developed for such systems have usually been designed to \
		display properly without gamma correction.  Gamma correction involves \
		passing pixels through a function of the form __X = W{^1/G}__, where G \
		is the "gamma correction factor" and should be equal to the gamma of the \
		monitor.  So the final output is __Y = X{^G} = (W{^1/G}){^G} = W__, which \
		describes a linear relationship between the intensity of the pixels drawn \
		by the application and the intensity of the pixels displayed by the \
		monitor. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__''VGL_GAMMA=1'' or ''vglrun +g'' : Enable gamma correction with default \
			settings__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		This option tells VirtualGL to enable gamma correction using the best \
		available method.  If VirtualGL is remotely displaying to a Solaris/Sparc \
		X server which has gamma-corrected X visuals, then VGL will attempt to \
		assign one of these visuals to the application.  This causes the 3D \
		output of the application to be gamma corrected by the factor specified \
		in ''fbconfig'' on the client machine (default: 2.22.)  Otherwise, if the \
		X server does not have gamma-corrected X visuals or if the \
		gamma-corrected visuals it has do not match the application's needs, then \
		VirtualGL performs gamma correction internally and uses a default gamma \
		correction factor of 2.22.  This option emulates the default behavior of \
		OpenGL applications running locally on Sparc machines. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__''VGL_GAMMA=0'' or ''vglrun -g'' : Disable gamma correction__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		This option tells VGL not to use gamma-corrected visuals, even if they are \
		available on the X server, and disables VGL's internal gamma correction \
		system as well.  This emulates the default behavior of OpenGL \
		applications running locally on Linux or Solaris/x86 machines. \

		{nl}{nl} \
		If ''VGL_GAMMA'' is set to an arbitrary floating point value, then \
		VirtualGL performs gamma correction internally using the specified value \
		as the gamma correction factor.  You can also specify a negative \
		value to apply a "de-gamma" function.  Specifying a gamma correction \
		factor of G (where G < 0) is equivalent to specifying a gamma correction \
		factor of -1/G. \

	| __ The location of an alternate OpenGL library__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, VirtualGL loads the first OpenGL dynamic library that it finds \
		in the dynamic linker path (usually ''/usr/lib/libGL.so.1'', \
		''/usr/lib64/libGL.so.1'',  or ''/usr/lib/64/libGL.so.1''.)  You can use \
		this setting to explicitly specify another OpenGL dynamic library to \
		load. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, you shouldn't need to muck with this unless something doesn't \
		work.  However, this setting is necessary when using VirtualGL with \
		[[chromium.txt#Chromium][Chromium]]. \

| ''VGL_GUI'' | {:} \
	| __Key sequence used to invoke the configuration dialog__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		VirtualGL will normally monitor an application's X event queue and pop up \
		the VirtualGL configuration dialog whenever ''CTRL-SHIFT-F9'' is pressed. \
		In the event that this interferes with a key sequence that the \
		application is already using, you can redefine the key sequence used to \
		pop up VGL's configuration dialog by setting ''VGL_GUI'' to some \
		combination of ''shift'', ''ctrl'', ''alt'', and one of \
		''{f1, f2, ..., f12}''.  You can also set ''VGL_GUI'' to ''none'' to \

	| __0 to prevent VGL from calling ''XtToolkitThreadInitialize()''__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Xt & Motif applications are supposed to call \
		''XtToolkitThreadInitialize()'' if they plan to access Xt functions from \
		two or more threads simultaneously.  But rarely, a multi-threaded \
		Xt/Motif application may avoid calling ''XtToolkitThreadInitialize()'' \
		and rely on the fact that avoiding this call disables application and \
		process locks.  This behavior is generally considered errant on the part \
		of the application, but the application developers have probably figured \
		out other ways around the potential instability that this situation \
		creates. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		The problem arises whenever VirtualGL pops up its configuration dialog \
		(which is written using Xt.)  In order to create this dialog, VirtualGL \
		creates a new Xt thread and calls ''XtToolkitThreadInitialize()'' as it \
		is supposed to do to guarantee thread safety.  But if the application \
		into which VGL is loaded exhibits the errant behavior described above, \
		suddenly enabling application and process locks may cause the application \
		to deadlock.  Setting ''VGL_GUI_XTTHREADINIT'' to ''0'' will remove VGL's \
		call to ''XtToolkitThreadInitialize()'' and should thus eliminate the \
		deadlock.\
		{nl}{nl} \
		In short, if you try to pop up the VirtualGL config dialog and notice \
		that it hangs the application, try setting ''VGL_GUI_XTTHREADINIT'' to \
		''0''. \

| ''VGL_INTERFRAME=0''{nl}''VGL_INTERFRAME=1'' | {:} \
	| __Enable/disable interframe image comparison__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		In Direct Mode, VGL will normally compare each image tile in the frame \
		with the corresponding image tile in the previous frame and send only \
		the tiles that have changed.  Setting ''VGL_INTERFRAME'' to ''0'' \
		disables this behavior. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, you shouldn't need to disable interframe comparison except in \
		rare situations.  This setting was introduced in order to work around a \

		{nl}{nl} \
		VirtualGL can divide the task of compressing each frame among multiple \

		compression stage of the pipeline is the primary bottleneck.  The default \
		behavior (equivalent to setting ''VGL_NPROCS=0'') is to use all but one \
		of the available CPUs, up to a maximum of 3 total.  On a large \
		multiprocessor system, the speedup is almost linear up to 3 processors, \
		but the algorithm scales very little past that point.  VirtualGL will not \
		allow more than 4 processors total to be used for compression, nor will \
		it allow you to assign more processors than are available in the system. \

	| __Fine-tune the amount of JPEG compression__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		In digital images, "frequency" refers to how quickly the color changes \
		between light and dark as you move either horizontally or vertically \
		in the image.  Images with very sharp, bright features on a dark \
		background, for instance, consist of both low- and high-frequency \
		components, whereas images with smooth transitions between each pixel \
		contain only low-frequency components.  JPEG compression works by \
		breaking down the image into its constituent frequencies and then \
		throwing out the highest of these frequencies.  The JPEG image "quality" \
		determines which frequencies are thrown out.  A JPEG quality of 1 throws \
		out all but the lowest frequencies and thus produces a very \
		impressionistic, but generally not very useful, compressed image.  A JPEG \
		quality of 100 retains all frequencies in the original image (but, due to \
		roundoff errors, is still not completely lossless.) \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Because the human eye usually can't detect the highest frequencies in the \
		image, and often because the image lacks those high-frequency elements to \
		begin with, a sufficiently high JPEG quality setting can produce a \
		"perceptually lossless" image.  A "perceptually lossless" image contains \
		a small amount of mathematical error vs. the original image, but this \
		error is so small that the human visual system cannot distinguish it \
		(under normal circumstances.)  The threshold quality level at which JPEG \
		compression becomes perceptually lossless is different for each image, \
		but experiments with various visual difference benchmarks (such as \
		[[http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/hdr/vdp/][HDR-VDP]]) suggest that \
		a JPEG quality of 95 is sufficient to guarantee perceptual \
		losslessness in the types of applications (volume visualization apps, \
		in particular) where image quality is critical.  As with any benchmarks, \
		Your Mileage May Vary.  If quality is of paramount concern, consider \
		setting the JPEG quality to 100, using RGB encoding, or enabling the \
		''VGL_PROGRESSIVE'' option. \

| ''VGL_READBACK=0''{nl}''VGL_READBACK=1'' | {:} \
	| __Enable/disable readback__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		On rare occasions, it might be desirable to have VirtualGL redirect \
		OpenGL rendering from an application into a Pbuffer but not automatically \
		read back and send the rendered pixels.  Some applications have their own \
		 mechanisms for reading back the buffer, so disabling VirtualGL's \
		readback mechanism prevents duplication of effort. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		This feature was developed initially to support running \
		[[http://www.paraview.org/][ParaView]] in parallel using MPI.  ParaView \
		MPI normally uses MPI processes 1 through N as rendering servers, each \
		drawing a portion of the geometry into a separate window on a \
		separate X display.  ParaView reads back these server windows and \
		composites the pixels into the main application window, which is \
		controlled by MPI process 0.  By creating a script which passes a \
		different value of ''VGL_DISPLAY'' and ''VGL_READBACK'' to each MPI \
		process, it is possible to make all of the ParaView server processes \
		render to off-screen buffers on different graphics cards while \
		preventing VirtualGL from displaying any pixels except those generated by \
		process 0. \

		{nl}{nl} \
		By default, VirtualGL will drop frames so as not to slow down the \
		rendering rate of the server's graphics engine.  This should produce the \
		best results with interactive applications, but it may be desirable to \
		turn off frame spoiling when running benchmarks or other non-interactive \
		applications.  Turning off frame spoiling will force one frame to be read \
		back and sent on each end-of-frame event, so that the frame rate reported \
		by OpenGL benchmarks will accurately reflect the frame rate seen by the \
		user.  Disabling frame spoiling also prevents non-interactive \
		applications from wasting graphics resources by rendering frames that \
		will never be seen.  With frame spoiling turned off, the 3D rendering \
		pipeline behaves as if it is fill-rate limited to about 30 or 40 \
		Megapixels/second, the maximum throughput of the VirtualGL system on \
		current CPU's. \

	|	__Manually specify the level of chrominance subsampling (1x, 2x, 4x, or \
		gray) in the JPEG compressor__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		When an image is compressed as JPEG, each pixel in the image is first \
		converted from RGB (Red/Green/Blue) to YUV.  An RGB pixel has three \
		values that specify the amounts of red, green, and blue that make up the \
		pixel's color.  A YUV pixel has three values that specify the overall \
		brightness of the pixel (Y, or "luminance") and the overall color of the \
		pixel (U and V, or "chrominance".) \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Since the human eye is less sensitive to changes in color than it is to \
		changes in brightness, the JPEG standard allows one to throw away the \
		chrominance components for some of the pixels.  This technique, called \
		"chrominance subsampling", significantly reduces the size of the \
		compressed image without causing much noticeable loss in image quality. \
		By default, VirtualGL uses no chrominance subsampling (AKA "1x \
		subsampling") when it compresses images for delivery to the client. \
		"2x subsampling" discards the chrominance components for every other \
		pixel along the image's X direction (this is also known as "4:2:2 \
		subsampling.")  Similarly, "4x subsampling" discards the chrominance \
		components for every other pixel along both the X and Y directions of \
		the image (this is also known as "4:2:0 subsampling.") Grayscale throws \
		out all chrominance components, leaving only luminance. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		All else being equal, 2x subsampling generally produces images that are \
		about 20-25% smaller than images with no subsampling.  Thus, VirtualGL \
		will generally consume about 20-25% less network bandwidth if 2x \
		subsampling is enabled.  Similarly, 4x subsampling will generally reduce \
		the network usage by about 35-40%. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Subsampling artifacts are rarely observed with volume data, \
		since it usually only contains 256 colors to begin with.  But narrow, \
		aliased lines and other sharp features on a black background will tend to \
		produce artifacts when subsampling is enabled. \

	| __Enable/disable strict 2D/3D synchronization (necessary to pass GLX \
			conformance tests)__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, VirtualGL's operation is asynchronous from the point of view of \
		the application.  The application swaps the buffers or calls \
		''glFinish()'' or ''glFlush()'' or ''glXWaitGL()'', and VirtualGL reads \
		back the framebuffer and sends the pixels to the client's display ... \
		eventually.  This will work fine for the vast majority of applications, \
		but it is not strictly conformant.  Technically speaking, when an \
		application calls ''glXWaitGL()'' or ''glFinish()'', it is well within \
		its rights to expect the OpenGL-rendered pixels to be immediately \
		available in the X window.  Fortunately, very few applications actually \
		do expect this, but on rare occasions, an application may try to use \
		''XGetImage()'' or other X11 functions to obtain a bitmap of the pixels \
		that were rendered by OpenGL.  Enabling ''VGL_SYNC'' is a somewhat \
		extreme measure that may be needed to get such applications to work \
		properly.  It was developed primarily as a way to pass the GLX \
		conformance suite (''conformx'', specifically.)  When ''VGL_SYNC'' is \
		enabled, every call to ''glFinish()'' or ''glXWaitGL()'' will cause the \
		contents of the server's framebuffer to be read back and __synchronously__ \
		drawn into the client's window __without compression or frame spoiling__. \
		The call to ''glFinish()'' or ''glXWaitGL()'' will not return until \
		VirtualGL has verified that the pixels have been delivered into the \
		client's window.  As such, enabling this mode can have potentially dire \
		effects on performance. \

| ''VGL_TILESIZE'' | {:} \
	| __A number between 8 and 1024 (inclusive)__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, in Direct Mode, VirtualGL will divide an OpenGL window into \
		tiles of 256x256 pixels, compare each tile vs. the previous frame, and \
		only compress & send the tiles which have changed.  It will also divide \
		up the task of compressing these tiles among the available CPUs in a \
		round robin fashion, if multi-threaded compression is enabled.  There are \
		several tradeoffs that must be considered when choosing a tile size: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Smaller tile sizes: \
		{list: \
			{item: Better parallel scalability} \
			{item: Worse compression efficiency} \
			{item: Better inter-frame optimization} \
			{item: Worse network efficiency}} \
		Larger tile sizes: \
		{list: \
			{item: Worse parallel scalability} \
			{item: Better compression efficiency} \
			{item: Worse inter-frame optimization} \
			{item: Better network efficiency}} \
		{nl} \
		Smaller tiles can more easily be divided up among multiple CPUs, but they \
		compress less efficiently (and less quickly) on an individual basis.  \
		Using larger tiles can reduce traffic to the client by allowing the \
		server to send only one frame update instead of many.  But on the flip \
		side, using larger tiles decreases the chance that a tile will be \
		unchanged from the previous frame.  Thus, the server may only send one or \
		two packets per frame, but the cumulative size of those packets may be \
		much larger than if a smaller tile size was used. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		256x256 was chosen as the default because, in experiments, it provided \
		the best balance between scalability and efficiency on the platforms that \
		VirtualGL supports. \

		{nl}{nl} \
		When tracing is enabled, VirtualGL will log all calls to the GLX and X11 \
		functions it is intercepting, as well as the arguments, return values, \
		and execution times for those functions.  This is useful when diagnosing \
		interaction problems between VirtualGL and a particular OpenGL \
		application. \

| ''VGL_VERBOSE=0''{nl}''VGL_VERBOSE=1'' | ''-v''{nl}or{nl}''+v'' \
	| __Enable/disable verbosity__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		When in verbose mode, VirtualGL will reveal some of the decisions it \
		makes behind the scenes, such as which code path it is using to compress \
		JPEG images, which type of X11 drawing it is using, etc.  This can be \
		helpful when diagnosing performance problems. \

| ''VGL_X11LIB'' | {:} \
	| __the location of an alternate X11 library__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, VirtualGL loads the first X11 dynamic library that it finds in \
		the dynamic linker path (usually ''/usr/lib/libX11.so.?'', \
		''/usr/lib/64/libX11.so.?'', ''/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.?'', or \
		''/usr/X11R6/lib64/libX11.so.?''.)  You can use this setting to \
		explicitly specify another X11 dynamic library to load. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Normally, you shouldn't need to muck with this unless something doesn't \
		work. \
	| {:} |
| ''VGL_XVENDOR'' | {:} \
	| __Return a fake X11 vendor string when the application calls \
		''XServerVendor()''__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		Some applications expect ''XServerVendor()'' to return a particular \
		value, which the application (sometimes erroneously) uses to figure out \
		whether it's running locally or remotely.  This setting allows you to \
		fool such applications into thinking they're running on a "local" X \
		server rather than a remote connection. \
