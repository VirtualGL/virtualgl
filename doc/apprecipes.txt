|| Application || Platform || Recipe || Notes ||
| ANSA v12.1.0 | Linux/x86 \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''LD_PRELOAD_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD''{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD='' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of the ''ansa.sh'' script, then add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD_SAVE'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		just prior to the ''${ANSA_EXEC_DIR}bin/ansa_linux${ext2}'' line. \
	| The ANSA startup script directly invokes ''/lib/libc.so.6'' to query \
		the glibc version.  Since the VirtualGL faker depends on libc, preloading \
		VirtualGL when directly invoking ''libc.so.6'' creates an infinite loop. \
		So it is necessary to disable the preloading of VirtualGL in the \
		application script and then re-enable it prior to launching the actual \
		application. \

| I-deas Master Series 9, 10, & 11 | Solaris/Sparc \
	| When running I-deas with VirtualGL on a Solaris/Sparc server, remotely \
		displaying to a non-Sparc client machine or to an X proxy such as VNC, \
		it may be necessary to set the ''SDRC_SUN_IGNORE_GAMMA'' environment \
		variable to ''1''. \
	| I-deas normally aborts if it detects that the X visual assigned to it is \
		not gamma-corrected.  But gamma-corrected X visuals only exist on \
		Solaris/Sparc X servers, so if you are displaying the application to \
		another type of X server or X proxy which doesn't provide gamma-corrected \
		X visuals, then it is necessary to override the gamma detection mechanism \
		in I-deas. \
	|
| Java2D applications that use OpenGL | Linux, Solaris \
	| Java2D will use OpenGL to perform its rendering if ''sun.java2d.opengl'' \
		is set to ''True''.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		In order for this to work in VirtualGL, it is necessary to invoke \
		''vglrun'' with the ''-dl'' switch.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''vglrun -dl java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If you are using Java v6 b92 or later, you can also set the environment \
		variable ''J2D_ALT_LIBGL_PATH'' to the path of ''librrfaker.so''.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''setenv J2D_ALT_LIBGL_PATH /opt/VirtualGL/lib/librrfaker.so''{nl} \
		''vglrun java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| Java2D applications that use OpenGL | Solaris/Sparc \
	| When VirtualGL is used in conjunction with Java v5.0 (also known as Java \
		1.5.0) to remotely display Java2D applications using the OpenGL pipeline \
		(see above), certain Java2D applications will cause the OpenGL subsystem \
		to crash with the following error: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''thread tries to access GL context current to another thread'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If you encounter this error, try setting the ''SUN_OGL_IS_MT'' environment \
		variable to ''1'' and re-running the application. \
	| Java 5.0 should call ''glXInitThreadsSUN()'' since it is using multiple \
		OpenGL threads, but it doesn't.  Purely by chance, this doesn't cause any \
		problems when the application is displayed locally.  But VirtualGL \
		changes things up enough that the luck runs out.  This issue does not \
		exist in Java 6. \

| Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire v2.0 | Solaris/Sparc \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''graphics opengl'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to ''~/config.pro''.  You may also need to set the ''VGL_XVENDOR'' \
		environment variable to ''"Sun Microsystems, Inc."'' if you are running \
		Pro/ENGINEER 2.0 over a remote X connection to a Linux or Windows \
		VirtualGL client. \
	|	Pro/E 2.0 for Solaris will disable OpenGL if it detects a remote \
		connection to a non-Sun X server. \
	|
| Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire v3.0 | Solaris/Sparc \
	| When using the VGL Image Transport, set the environment variable \
		''VGL_INTERFRAME'' to ''0'' on the VirtualGL server prior to launching \
		Pro/E v3. \
	| Pro/E v3 frequently renders to the front buffer and, for unknown \
		reasons, sends long sequences of ''glFlush()'' calls (particularly in \
		wireframe mode) even if nothing new has been rendered.  This causes VGL \
		to send long sequences of duplicate images into the VGL Image Transport \
		pipeline.  If interframe comparison is enabled, the overhead of comparing \
		these duplicate images can lead to slow application performance when \
		zooming in or out in Pro/E.  It's faster to disable interframe comparison \
		in this case and simply let VGL's frame spoiling system discard any \
		frames that it can't send in real time.  This results in only a few of \
		the duplicate frames being sent to the client with no CPU time wasted on \
		comparing the hundreds of other duplicate frames that won't be sent. \

| QGL (OpenGL Qt Widget) | Linux \
	| ''vglrun -dl {application}'' \
	| Qt can be built such that it either resolves symbols from libGL \
		automatically or uses ''dlopen()'' to manually resolve those symbols \
		from libGL.  As of Qt v3.3, the latter behavior is the default, so \
		OpenGL programs built with later versions of libQt will not work with \
		VirtualGL unless the ''-dl'' switch is used with ''vglrun''. \
