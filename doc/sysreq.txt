VirtualGL should build and run on Itanium Linux, but it has not been thoroughly
tested.  [[http://sourceforge.net/users/dcommander][Contact us]] if you
encounter any difficulties.

	!!! Solaris 10/x86 comes with mediaLib pre-installed, but it is
	strongly recommended that you upgrade this version of mediaLib to at least
	2.4.  This will greatly increase the performance of Solaris/x86 VirtualGL
	clients as well as the performance of 32-bit apps on Solaris/x86 VirtualGL
	servers.
