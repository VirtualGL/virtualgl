* Using VirtualGL with X Proxies Such as VNC
{anchor: X11_Proxy_Usage}

The VGL Transport is a good solution for using VirtualGL over a fast
network.  However, the VGL Transport is not generally suitable for high-latency
or low-bandwidth networks, due to its reliance on the X11 protocol to send the
non-3D elements of the 3D application's GUI.  The VGL Transport also
requires an X server to be running on the client machine, which makes it
generally more difficult to deploy and use on Windows clients.
VirtualGL can be used with an "X proxy" to overcome these limitations.  An X
proxy acts as a virtual X server, receiving X11 commands from the application
(and from VirtualGL), rendering the X11 commands into images, compressing the
resulting images, and sending the compressed images over the network to a
client or clients.  X proxies perform well on all types of networks, including
high-latency and low-bandwidth networks.  They often provide rudimentary
collaboration capabilities, allowing multiple clients to simultaneously view
the same X session and pass around control of the keyboard and mouse.  X
proxies are also stateless, meaning that the client can disconnect and
reconnect at will from any machine on the network, and the 3D application will
remain running on the server.

Since VirtualGL is sending rendered 3D images to the X proxy at a very fast
rate, the proxy must be able to compress the images very quickly in order to
keep up.  Unfortunately, however, most X proxies can't.  They simply aren't
designed to compress, with any degree of performance, the large and complex
images generated by 3D applications.  Therefore, the VirtualGL Project provides
an optimized X proxy called "TurboVNC", a variant of
[[http://www.tightvnc.com][TightVNC]] that is designed specifically to achieve
high levels of performance with 3D applications running in VirtualGL.  More
information about TurboVNC, including instructions for using it with VirtualGL,
can be found in the TurboVNC User's Guide.

Many other X proxy solutions work well with VirtualGL, and some of these
solutions provide compelling features (seamless windows, for instance, or
session management), but none of these X proxies matches the performance of
TurboVNC, as of this writing.

** Using VirtualGL with an X Proxy on the Same Server
{anchor: X11_Proxy_Usage_Local}

The most common (and optimal) way to use VirtualGL with an X proxy is to set up
both on the same server.  This allows VirtualGL to send its rendered 3D images
to the X proxy through shared memory rather than sending them over a network.

With this configuration, you can usually invoke

#Verb: <<---
/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglrun {application_executable_or_script}
---

from a terminal inside of the X proxy session, and it will "just work."
VirtualGL reads the value of the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable to determine
whether to enable the X11 Transport by default.  If ''DISPLAY'' begins with a
colon ("'':''") or with "''unix:''", then VirtualGL will assume that the X
connection is local and will enable the X11 Transport as the default.  In
some cases, however, the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable in the X proxy
session may not begin with a colon or "''unix:''".  In these cases, it is
necessary to manually enable the X11 Transport by setting the ''VGL_COMPRESS''
environment variable to ''proxy'' or by passing an argument of ''-c proxy'' to
''vglrun''.

** Using VirtualGL with an X Proxy on a Different Machine

If the X proxy and VirtualGL are running on different servers, then it is
desirable to use the VGL Transport to send images from the VirtualGL
server to the X proxy.  It is also desirable to disable image compression in
the VGL Transport.  Otherwise, the images would have to be compressed by
the VirtualGL server, decompressed by the VirtualGL Client, then recompressed
by the X proxy, which is a waste of CPU resources.  However, sending images
uncompressed over a network requires a fast network (generally, Gigabit
Ethernet or faster), so there needs to be a fast link between the VirtualGL
server and the X proxy server for this procedure to perform well.

The procedure for using the VGL Transport to display 3D applications from a
VirtualGL server to a remote X proxy is the same as the
[[#X11_Forwarding][procedure]] for using the VGL Transport to display
3D applications from a VirtualGL server to a remote 2D X server, with the
following exceptions:

	#. The "client" in this case is really the X proxy server.

	#. The "X server" is really the X proxy.

	#. It is recommended that you disable image compression in the VGL Transport
		by either setting the ''VGL_COMPRESS'' environment variable to ''rgb'' or
		passing an argument of ''-c rgb'' to ''vglrun'' when launching VirtualGL.
		Otherwise, VirtualGL will detect that the connection to the X server is
		remote, and it will automatically try to enable JPEG compression.
