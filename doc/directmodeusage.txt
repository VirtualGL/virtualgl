*** Security Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

X11 traffic is encrypted, but the VirtualGL image stream is left unencrypted to
maximize performance.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Start the X server/Exceed if it isn't started already.

	#. Start the VirtualGL Client program:

		Linux clients :: Open a terminal window and type
		#Verb: <<---
		vglclient
		---

		Solaris clients :: Open a terminal window and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglclient
		---

		Windows clients :: If the VirtualGL client has not been started as a
		service, then start it manually by selecting __Start VirtualGL Client__
		in the __VirtualGL Client__ Start Menu group.

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window.

	#. {:}
		Linux and Solaris clients :: In the new terminal window, type

		#Verb: <<---
		echo $DISPLAY
		---

		and make a note of the value.

		Windows clients :: In the new Command Prompt window, type
		#Verb: <<---
		set DISPLAY localhost:{n}.0
		---
		Replace ''{n}'' with the display number that Exceed is occupying.  To
		obtain this, hover over the Exceed icon in the taskbar and make a note of
		the value it displays (usually '':0.0'', unless you have multiple Exceed
		sessions running.)

	#. In the same Command Prompt/terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSh)
		session into the VirtualGL server by typing:

		#Verb: <<---
		ssh -X {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace ''{user}'' with your user account name on the VirtualGL server and
		''{server}'' with the hostname or IP address of that server.

		!!! If using PuTTY, replace ''ssh'' with ''putty'' in the above example.

	#. If the X server on your client machine is using a display number of 0
		(usually the case), then you can skip this step.  Otherwise, set the
		''VGL_CLIENT'' environment variable on the VirtualGL server to point
		to the client's X display:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		export VGL_CLIENT={client}:{n}.0
		---
		or
		#Verb: <<---
		setenv VGL_CLIENT {client}:{n}.0
		---

		Replace ''{client}'' with the hostname or IP address of your client machine
		(''echo $SSH_CLIENT'' if you don't know this) and ''{n}'' with the display
		number of the client machine's X display (obtained in Step 4.)

	#. In the SSh session, start the 3D application using VirtualGL:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

		Solaris server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

	information on ''vglrun'' command line options.

** Direct Mode with a Direct X11 Connection
{anchor: Direct_X11_Connection}

*** Performance

*** Security Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

	- Both the X11 traffic and the VirtualGL image stream are unencrypted.
	- Some newer Linux and Solaris distributions ship with default settings that
		do not allow TCP connections into the X server.  Such systems cannot be
		used as clients with this procedure unless they are reconfigured to allow
		X11 TCP connections.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Start the X server/Exceed if it isn't started already.

	#. Start the VirtualGL Client program:

		Linux clients :: Open a terminal window and type
		#Verb: <<---
		vglclient
		---

		Solaris clients :: Open a terminal window and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglclient
		---

		Windows clients :: If the VirtualGL client has not been started as a
		service, then start it manually by selecting __Start VirtualGL Client__
		in the __VirtualGL Client__ Start Menu group.

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window.

	#. {:}
		Linux and Solaris clients ::	In the new terminal window, type

		#Verb: <<---
		echo $DISPLAY
		---

		and make a note of the value.

		Windows clients :: Hover over the Exceed icon in the taskbar, and make a
		note of the display number that Exceed is occupying (usually '':0.0'',
		unless you have multiple Exceed sessions running.)

	#. {:}
		Linux and Solaris clients :: In the same terminal window, type
		#Verb: <<---
		xhost +{server}
		---
		Replace ''{server}'' with the hostname or IP address of the VirtualGL
		server.

		Windows clients :: Configure Exceed to grant display access to any
		VirtualGL servers that you plan to use.

			a. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then
				select __Tools-->Configuration__.)

			b. In XConfig, open the "Security Access Control and System Administration"
				applet (if using Category View) or the "Security" applet (if using
				Classic View.)

			c. Select "File" under "Host Access Control List", then click the "Edit"
				button.  This opens ''xhost.txt'' in Notepad.
				{img: exceed5.png}

			d. Add the hostnames or IP addresses of any VirtualGL servers you plan to
				use to this file (one per line), save the file, and exit Notepad.

			e. Back in XConfig, click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If prompted to
				reset the X server, click "Yes."

	#. In the Command Prompt/terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSh) session
		into the VirtualGL server by typing:

		#Verb: <<---
		ssh {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace ''{user}'' with your user account name on the VirtualGL server and
		''{server}'' with the hostname or IP address of that server.

		!!! If using PuTTY, replace ''ssh'' with ''putty'' in the above example.

	#. If the X server on your client machine is using a display number of 0
		(usually the case), then you can skip this step.  Otherwise, set the
		''DISPLAY'' environment variable on the VirtualGL server to point to
		the client's X display:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		export DISPLAY={client}:{n}.0
		---
		or
		#Verb: <<---
		setenv DISPLAY {client}:{n}.0
		---

		Replace ''{client}'' with the hostname or IP address of your client machine
		(''echo $SSH_CLIENT'' if you don't know this) and ''{n}'' with the display
		number of the client machine's X display (obtained in Step 4.)

	#. In the SSh session, start the 3D application using VirtualGL:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---
		Solaris server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

	Consult {ref prefix="Section ": Advanced_Configuration} for more
	information on ''vglrun'' command line options.

** Direct Mode with SSL Encryption

*** Performance
#OPT: noList! plain!

On high-speed networks such as Ethernet, VirtualGL's performance is reduced by
as much as 20% by enabling SSL encryption.

*** Security Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

	- The VirtualGL image stream is encrypted.
	- When used in conjunction with X11 Forwarding, this provides a completely
		secure solution.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

Pass an argument of ''+s'' to ''vglrun'' when launching VirtualGL, or set
the environment variable ''VGL_SSL'' to ''1'' on the VirtualGL server.
(see {ref prefix="Section ": Advanced_Configuration} for more details.)

** Direct Mode with X11 Forwarding and SSh Tunneling

*** Performance
#OPT: noList! plain!

	- On high-speed networks such as Ethernet, VirtualGL's performance is reduced
		by as much as 20% by enabling SSh Tunneling.
	- SSh tunneling using OpenSSH (Cygwin or SSHWindows on Windows machines)
		generally performs about the same as VirtualGL's built-in SSL encryption.
	- SSh tunneling using PuTTY generally performs about 30% slower than OpenSSH
		or VirtualGL's built-in SSL encryption.

*** Security Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

	- Both the X11 traffic and the VirtualGL image stream are encrypted.
	- Use SSh Tunneling if a firewall separates the client and server machines,
		thus making it impossible for the VirtualGL server to make a Direct Mode
		connection to the VirtualGL client.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

The procedure is the same as for the [[#X11_Forwarding][X11 Forwarding]] case,
except that the following additional steps need to be taken:

	#. Once connected to the VirtualGL server via. SSh, execute the following
		command:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/nettest -findport
		---

		Solaris server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/nettest -findport
		---

	This program will allocate a free TCP port number and print the number to
	the console.  Make a note of it.

	#. Close the SSh session and re-open it using the following command line:

		#Verb: <<---
		ssh -X -R {port}:localhost:4242 {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace ''{port}'' with the port number you obtained in Step 1.

		!!! If you are using an OpenSSH client, you can also type the following
		key sequence: ''<ENTER> ~ C'' (that's the Enter key, followed by a tilde,
		followed by a capital C), which will bring up an ''ssh>'' prompt at
		which you can enter ''-R {port}:localhost:4242''.  This allows you to set
		up the tunnel without closing and re-opening the SSh session.

	#. Once connected to the server for the second time, set the ''VGL_PORT''
		environment variable to match the port number you obtained above.

	#. Set the ''VGL_CLIENT'' environment variable on the VirtualGL server to
		''localhost:{n}.0'', where ''{n}'' is the display number of the X server
		running on the client machine.

		!!! Explanation: When you established the SSh connection using the ''-R''
		argument, it created a listener on the VirtualGL server.  That listener
		will accept a connection from VirtualGL and forward the connection over
		the SSh tunnel to port 4242 on the client machine.  Thus, you need to set
		''VGL_PORT'' and ''VGL_CLIENT'' on the VirtualGL server to tell VirtualGL
		to make a connection to the SSh listener rather than the "real" VirtualGL
		client program.
