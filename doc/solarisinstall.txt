* Configuring a Solaris Machine as a VirtualGL Server

** GLP: Using VirtualGL Without an X Server
{anchor: GLP_Usage}

Sun's OpenGL library for Sparc systems has a special extension called "GLP"
which allows VirtualGL to directly access a 3D graphics card even if there is
no X server running on the card.  Apart from greatly simplifying the process of
configuring the VirtualGL server, GLP also greatly improves the overall
security of the VirtualGL server, since it eliminates the need to grant X
server access to VirtualGL users.  In addition, GLP makes it easy to assign
VirtualGL jobs to any graphics card in a multi-card system.

If your system is running [[http://www.sun.com/software/graphics/opengl/][Sun OpenGL]]
1.5 for Sparc/Solaris, it is recommended that you configure it to use GLP:

	#. Log in as root.

	#. Create a new group called ''vglusers'' and add any users that need to
		run VirtualGL to this group.

	#. If the ''/etc/dt/config'' directory does not exist, create it.

		#Verb: <<---
		mkdir -p /etc/dt/config
		---

		Make sure that ''/etc/dt/config'' has global read/execute permissions.

	#. Create a file called ''GraphicsDevices'' under ''/etc/dt/config'' and add
		any framebuffer device paths in your system (''/dev/fbs/kfb0'',
		''/dev/fbs/jfb0'', etc.) to this file, one device per line.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		touch /etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices
		for i in /dev/fbs/*[0-9]; do echo $i >>/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices; done
		---

		You can choose to include only certain framebuffer devices in this file.
		Only the devices listed in ''GraphicsDevices'' will be available for use by
		VirtualGL.

	#. Grant read access to this file for the ''vglusers'' group.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		chgrp vglusers /etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices
		chmod 640 /etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices
		---

If you wish to make GLP the default for all users of the system, you can add

#Verb: <<---
VGL_DISPLAY=glp
export VGL_DISPLAY
---

to ''/etc/profile''.  This will cause VirtualGL to use the first device
specified in ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' as the default rendering
device.  Users can override this default by setting ''VGL_DISPLAY'' in one of
their startup scripts (such as ''~/.profile'' or ''~/.login'') or by passing an
argument of ''-d <device>'' to ''vglrun'' when invoking VirtualGL.  See
{ref prefix="Section ": Advanced_Configuration} for more details.

** Granting Access to the Server's X Display

	!!! If you plan to use VirtualGL only with [[#GLP_Usage][GLP]], then you
	can skip this section.

VirtualGL requires access to the server's 3D graphics card so that it can
create off-screen pixel buffers (Pbuffers) and redirect the 3D rendering
from applications into these Pbuffers.  Unfortunately, accessing a 3D
graphics card on Solaris/x86 systems or on Solaris/Sparc systems without
[[#GLP_Usage][GLP]] requires going through an X server.  On such systems, the
only way to share the server's 3D graphics card among multiple users is
to grant those users access to the X server that is running on the 3D graphics
card.

It is important to understand the security risks associated with this.  Once
X display access is granted to a user, there is nothing that would prevent
that user from logging keystrokes or reading back images from the X display.
Using ''xauth'', one can obtain "untrusted" X authentication keys which prevent
such exploits, but unfortunately, those untrusted keys also disallow access to
the 3D hardware.  So it is necessary to grant full trusted X access to any
users that will need to run VirtualGL.  Unless you fully trust the users to
whom you are granting this access, you should avoid logging in locally to the
server's X display as root unless absolutely necessary.

This section will explain how to configure a VirtualGL server such that select
users can run VirtualGL, even if the server is sitting at the login prompt.
The basic idea is to call a script (''vglgenkey'') from the display manager's
startup script.  ''vglgenkey'' invokes ''xauth'' to generate an authorization
key for the server's X display, and it stores this key under
''/etc/opt/VirtualGL''.  The VirtualGL launcher script (''vglrun'') then
attempts to read this key and merge it into the user's ''.Xauthority'' file,
thus granting the user access to the server's X display.  Therefore, you can
control who has access to the server's X display simply by controlling who has
read access to the ''/etc/opt/VirtualGL'' directory.

If you prefer, you can also grant access to every authenticated
user on the server by replacing the references to ''vglgenkey'' below with
''xhost +localhost''.

*** If your system is using dtlogin as a display manager:
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Log in as root.

	#. Create a new group called ''vglusers'' and add any users that need to
		run VirtualGL to this group.

	#. Create a new directory ''/etc/opt/VirtualGL'' and make it readable by the
		''vglusers'' group.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		mkdir -p /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chgrp vglusers /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chmod 750 /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		---

	#. If the ''/etc/dt/config'' directory does not exist, create it.

		#Verb: <<---
		mkdir -p /etc/dt/config
		---

	#. If ''/etc/dt/config/Xsetup'' does not exist, then copy the default
		''Xsetup'' file from ''/usr/dt/config'' to that location:

		#Verb: <<---
		cp /usr/dt/config/Xsetup /etc/dt/config/Xsetup
		---

	#. Edit ''/etc/dt/config/Xsetup'', and add the following lines to the bottom
		of the file:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglgenkey
		---

	#. If ''/etc/dt/config/Xconfig'' does not exist, then copy the default
		''Xconfig'' file from ''/usr/dt/config'' to that location:

		#Verb: <<---
		cp /usr/dt/config/Xconfig /etc/dt/config/Xconfig
		---

	#. Edit ''/etc/dt/config/Xconfig'', and add (or uncomment) the following line:

		#Verb: <<---
		Dtlogin*grabServer: False
		---

		Explanation :: The ''Dtlogin*grabServer'' option restricts X display
		access to only the ''dtlogin'' process.  This is an added security measure,
		since it prevents a user from attaching any kind of sniffer program to the
		X display even if they have display access.  But ''Dtlogin*grabServer''
		also prevents VirtualGL from using the X display to access the 3D graphics
		hardware, so this option must be disabled for VirtualGL to work properly.

	 !!! If the system you are configuring as a VirtualGL server is also being
	 used as a Sun Ray server, then make these same modifications to
	 ''/etc/dt/config/Xconfig.SUNWut.prototype''.  Otherwise, the modifications
	 you just made to ''/etc/dt/config/Xconfig'' will be overwritten the next
	 time the system is restarted.

	#. Unless you know that you absolutely need it, disable the XTEST extension.
		Disabling XTEST will not prevent a user from logging keystrokes or reading
		images from the X display, but it will prevent them from inserting
		key and mouse events and thus hijacking a local X session.

		a. If ''/etc/dt/config/Xservers'' does not exist, then copy the default
			''Xservers'' file from ''/usr/dt/config'' to that location:

			#Verb: <<---
			cp /usr/dt/config/Xservers /etc/dt/config/Xservers
			---

		b. Edit ''/etc/dt/config/Xservers'' and add an argument of ''-tst'' to the
			line corresponding to the display number you are configuring.  For example:
			{nl}
			#Verb: <<---
			:0  Local local_uid@console root /usr/openwin/bin/Xsun :0 -nobanner -tst
			---

			!!! If the system you are configuring as a VirtualGL server is also being
			used as a Sun Ray server, then make these same modifications to
			''/etc/dt/config/Xservers.SUNWut.prototype''.  Otherwise, the
			modifications you just made to ''/etc/dt/config/Xservers'' will be
			overwritten the next time the system is restarted.

	#. Verify that ''/etc/dt/config'' and ''/etc/dt/config/Xsetup'' can be
		executed by all users, and verify that ''/etc/dt/config/Xconfig'' and
		''/etc/dt/config/Xservers'' can be read by all users.

	#. Restart the X server by issuing

		#Verb <<---
		/etc/init.d/dtlogin stop; /etc/init.d/dtlogin start
		---

	#. To check your work, log out of the server, log back in via. SSh, and
		run

		#Verb <<---
		/usr/openwin/bin/xauth merge /etc/opt/VirtualGL/vgl_xauth_key
		/usr/openwin/bin/xdpyinfo -display :0
		---

		In particular, make sure that XTEST doesn't show up in the list of
		extensions if you disabled it above.


*** If your system is using gdm as a display manager (gdm is available only on \
Solaris 10 or later):
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Log in as root.

	#. Create a new group called ''vglusers'' and add any users that need to
		run VirtualGL to this group.

	#. Create a new directory ''/etc/opt/VirtualGL'' and make it readable by the
		''vglusers'' group.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		mkdir -p /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chgrp vglusers /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chmod 750 /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		---

	#. Add

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglgenkey
		---

		to the top of the ''/etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default'' file.

	#. Edit ''/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf'' and add the following line under the
		''[security]'' section (or change it if it already exists):

		#Verb: <<---
		DisallowTCP=false
		---

	#. Unless you know that you absolutely need it, disable the XTEST extension.
		Disabling XTEST will not prevent a user from logging keystrokes or reading
		images from the X display, but it will prevent them from inserting
		key and mouse events and thus hijacking a local X session.{nl}
		{nl}
		Edit ''/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf'' and add ''-tst'' to all lines that appear to
		be X server command lines.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		StandardXServer=/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg -tst
		---
		#Verb: <<---
		[server-Standard]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg -tst -audit 0
		---
		#Verb: <<---
		[server-Terminal]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg -tst -audit 0 -terminate
		---
		#Verb: <<---
		[server-Chooser]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg -tst -audit 0
		---

	#. Restart gdm by issuing

		#Verb: <<---
		svcadm disable gdm2-login; svcadm enable gdm2-login
		---

	#. To check your work, log out of the server, log back in via. SSh, and
		run

		#Verb: <<---
		/usr/openwin/bin/xauth merge /etc/opt/VirtualGL/vgl_xauth_key
		/usr/openwin/bin/xdpyinfo -display :0
		---

		In particular, make sure that XTEST doesn't show up in the list of
		extensions if you disabled it above.

** Device Permissions

Whether the server's 3D graphics card is being accessed through GLP or through
an X server, you must perform the following procedure to enable VirtualGL users
to access the framebuffer device(s):

	1. Edit ''/etc/logindevperm'' and comment out the "frame buffers" line.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		# /dev/console    0600    /dev/fbs/*              # frame buffers
		---

	2. Change the permissions and group for ''/dev/fbs/*'' to allow write access
		to anyone who will need to use VirtualGL.  For example:
		{nl}
		#Verb: <<---
		chmod 660 /dev/fbs/*
		chown root /dev/fbs/*
		chgrp vglusers /dev/fbs/*
		---

 !!! Explanation: Normally, when someone logs into a Solaris machine, the
 system will automatically assign ownership of the framebuffer devices to
 that user and set the permissions for the framebuffer devices to those
 specified in ''/etc/logindevperm''.  The default setting in
 ''/etc/logindevperm'' disallows anyone from using the framebuffer devices
 except the user that is logged in.  But in order to run VirtualGL, a user
 needs write access to the framebuffer devices.  So in order to make the
 framebuffer a shared resource, it is necessary to disable the login device
 permissions mechanism for the framebuffer devices and manually set the owner
 and group for these devices such that any VirtualGL users can write to them.

** SSh Server Configuration

The server's SSh daemon should have the ''X11Forwarding'' option enabled and
the ''UseLogin'' option disabled.  This is configured in ''sshd_config'',
the location of which varies depending on your distribution of SSh.  Solaris
10 generally keeps this in ''/etc/ssh'', whereas Blastwave keeps it in
''/opt/csw/etc'' and SunFreeware keeps it in ''/usr/local/etc''.
