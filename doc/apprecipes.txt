|| Application || Platform || Recipe || Notes ||
| Abaqus v6.9 | Linux \
	| ''vglrun -nodl {abaqus_path}/abaqus'' \
	| User reports indicate that Abaqus 6.9 will not work properly if \
		''libdlfaker.so'' from VirtualGL is preloaded into it.  This may be true \
		for other versions of Abaqus as well. \
	|
| ANSA v12.1.0 | Linux \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''LD_PRELOAD_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD''{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD='' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of the ''ansa.sh'' script, then add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD_SAVE'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		just prior to the ''${ANSA_EXEC_DIR}bin/ansa_linux${ext2}'' line. \
	| The ANSA startup script directly invokes ''/lib/libc.so.6'' to query \
		the glibc version.  Since the VirtualGL faker depends on libc, preloading \
		VirtualGL when directly invoking ''libc.so.6'' creates an infinite loop. \
		So it is necessary to disable the preloading of VirtualGL in the \
		application script and then re-enable it prior to launching the actual \
		application. \

| Ansoft HFSS, Roxar RMS | Linux \
	| Set the ''VGL_SPOILLAST'' environment variable to ''0'' prior to \
		launching the application with ''vglrun'' \
	| These applications use double buffering and draw geometry to the back buffer, \
		but node highlighting and rubber banding are drawn directly to the front \
		buffer. In order for these front-buffer operations to be displayed \
		properly, it is necessary to use the "spoil first" frame spoiling \
		algorithm whenever the application calls ''glFlush()''.  See \
		{ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SPOILLAST} for more details. \
	|
| AutoForm v4.0x | All \
	| ''vglrun +sync xaf_''__''{version}''__ \
	| AutoForm relies on mixed X11/OpenGL rendering, and thus certain features \
		(particularly the "Dynamic Section" dialog and "Export Image" feature) do \
		not work properly unless ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled.  Since ''VGL_SYNC'' \
		automatically enables the X11 transport and disables frame spoiling, it \
		is highly recommended that you use an X proxy when ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled. \
		See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SYNC} for more details. \
	|
| Cedega v6.0.x | Linux \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of ''~/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-{version}/bin/winex3'', then \
		run Cedega as you would normally (without ''vglrun''.)  Since ''vglrun'' \
		is not being used, it is necessary to use environment variables or the \
		VirtualGL Configuration dialog to modify VirtualGL's configuration. \
	| The actual binary (WineX) which uses OpenGL is buried beneath several \
		layers of Python and shell scripts.  The ''LD_PRELOAD'' variable does not \
		get propagated down from the initial shell that invoked ''vglrun''. \

| Heretic II | Linux \
	| ''vglrun heretic2 +set vid_ref glx'' \
	| {:} \
