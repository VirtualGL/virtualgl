* Transport Plugins
{anchor:Transport_Plugins}

VirtualGL 2.2 (and later) includes an API that allows you to write your own
image transports.  Thus, you can use VirtualGL for doing split rendering and
pixel readback but then use your own library for delivering the pixels to the
client.

When the ''VGL_TRANSPORT'' environment variable (or the
''-trans'' option to ''vglrun'') is set to __''{t}''__, then VirtualGL will
look for a DSO (dynamic shared object) with the name
''libtransvgl_''__''{t}''__''.so'' in the dynamic linker path and will attempt
to access a set of API functions from this library.  The functions that the
plugin library must export are defined in
''/opt/VirtualGL/include/rrtransport.h'', and an example of their usage can be
found in ''server/testplugin.cpp'' and ''server/testplugin2.cpp'' in the
VirtualGL source distribution.  The former wraps the VGL Transport as an image
transport plugin, and the latter does the same for the X11 Transport.
