* Configuring a Windows Machine as a VirtualGL Direct Mode Client

	#. Install Hummingbird Exceed if it isn't already installed.

	#. Add the Exceed path (for instance, ''C:\\Program Files\\Hummingbird\\Connectivity\\9.00\\Exceed'')
		to the system ''PATH'' environment if it isn't already there.

	#. Install a Secure Shell (SSh) client.  If [[http://www.cygwin.com/][Cygwin]]
		is already installed, then you can use the SSh client included in Cygwin.
		Otherwise, download and install [[http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/][SSHWindows]]
		or [[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/][PuTTY]].
		''ssh.exe'' or ''putty.exe'' should be somewhere in your ''PATH''.

** Optimizing Exceed

*** Disabling Pixel Format Conversion and Backing Store
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. In the "X Server Protocol" applet, select the "Protocol" tab and make sure
		that "Use 32 bits per pixel for true color" is not checked.

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

	#. Open the "Other Server Settings" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Performance" applet instead. 

	#. Select the "Performance" tab and make sure that "Default Backing Store" is
		set to "None."

*** Enabling MIT-SHM
#OPT: noList! plain!

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
Hummingbird Exceed to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can improve
the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline by as much as 20% in some
cases.

The bad news is that this extension has some issues in earlier versions of
Exceed.  If you are using Exceed 8 or 9, you will need to obtain the following
patches from the Hummingbird support site:

|| Product || Patches Required || How to Obtain ||
| Hummingbird Exceed 8.0 \
| ''hclshm.dll'' v9.0.0.1 (or higher){nl} \
	''xlib.dll'' v9.0.0.3 (or higher){nl} \
	''exceed.exe'' v8.0.0.28 (or higher) \
| Download all patches from the \
	[[http://connectivity.hummingbird.com/support/nc/exceed_patches.html][Hummingbird support site]]. \
	{nl} \
	(__Hummingbird WebSupport account required__) \
|
| Hummingbird Exceed 9.0 \
| ''hclshm.dll'' v9.0.0.1 (or higher){nl} \
	''xlib.dll'' v9.0.0.3 (or higher){nl} \
	''exceed.exe'' v9.0.0.9 (or higher) \
| ''exceed.exe'' can be patched by running Hummingbird Update.{nl} \
	{nl} \
	All other patches must be downloaded from the \
	[[http://connectivity.hummingbird.com/support/nc/exceed_patches.html][Hummingbird support site]]. \
	{nl} \
	(__Hummingbird WebSupport account required__) \
|

No patches should be necessary for Exceed 10 and above.

Next, you need to enable the MIT-SHM extension in Exceed:

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. Select the "Extensions" tab and make sure that "MIT-SHM" is checked.
		{nl}{nl}
		{img: exceed2.png}

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

** Installing the VirtualGL Client as a Windows Service

The VirtualGL Windows Client can be installed as a Windows service (and
subsequently removed) using the links provided in the "VirtualGL Client" start
menu group.  Once installed, the service can be started from the Services
applet in the Control Panel (located under "Administrative Tools") or by
invoking

#Verb: <<---
net start vglclient
---

from a command prompt.  The service can be subsequently stopped by invoking

#Verb: <<---
net stop vglclient
---

If you wish to install the client as a service and have it listen on a port
other than the default (4242 for unencrypted connections or 4243 for SSL
connections), then you will need to install the service manually from the
command line.

#Verb: <<---
vglclient -?
---

gives a list of the relevant command-line options.
