** Server Settings

You can control the operation of the VirtualGL faker in four different ways.
Each method of configuration takes precedence over the previous method:

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable globally (for instance, in
		''/etc/profile'')

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable on a per-user basis (for instance, in
		''~/.bashrc'')

	#. Setting a configuration environment variable only for the current shell
		session (for instance, ''export VGL_XXX={whatever}'')

	#. Passing a configuration option as an argument to ''vglrun''.  This
		effectively overrides any previous environment variable setting
		corresponding to that configuration option.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_CLIENT = ''__''{c}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-cl ''__''{c}''__ |
| Summary | __''{c}''__ = the hostname or IP address of the VirtualGL client \
	machine or Sun Ray server |
| Image Transports | VGL |
| Default Value | Automatically set by ''vglconnect'' or ''vglrun'' |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When using the VGL Image Transport, ''VGL_CLIENT'' should be
	set to the hostname or IP address of the machine on which ''vglclient'' is
	running.  When using the Sun Ray Image Transport, ''VGL_CLIENT'' should be
	set to the hostname or IP address of the Sun Ray server.  Normally,
	''VGL_CLIENT'' is set automatically by the ''vglconnect'' or ''vglrun''
	script, so don't override it unless you know what you're doing. \

{anchor: VGL_COMPRESS}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_COMPRESS = ''__''proxy \| jpeg \| rgb \| sr \| srrgb''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-c ''__''proxy \| jpeg \| rgb \| sr \| srrgb''__ |
| Summary | Set image transport and image compression type |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | (See description) |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: {:}
	__proxy__ = Send images uncompressed using the X11 Image Transport.  This is
	useful when displaying to a local X server or X proxy (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": TurboVNC_Usage_Local}.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	__jpeg__ = Compress images using JPEG and send using the VGL Image Transport.
	This is useful when displaying to a remote X server (see
	{ref prefix="Chapter ": VGL_Image_Transport_Usage}.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	__rgb__ = Encode images as uncompressed RGB and send using the VGL Image
	Transport.  This is useful when displaying to a remote X server or X proxy
	across a very fast network (see
	{ref prefix="Section ": TurboVNC_Usage_Remote}.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	__sr__ = Compress images using the Sun Ray default compression method (DPCM)
	and send using the Sun Ray Image Transport.  This requires that the
	proprietary Sun Ray plugin be installed on the VirtualGL server.
	(see {ref prefix="Chapter ": Sun_Ray_Usage}.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	__srrgb__ = Encode images as uncompressed RGB and send using the Sun Ray
	Image Transport.  This requires that the proprietary Sun Ray plugin be
	installed on the VirtualGL server (see
	{ref prefix="Chapter ": Sun_Ray_Usage}.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	If this option is not specified, then the default is set as follows:
	{nl}{nl} \
	If the X server is a Sun Ray server and the Sun Ray plugin is installed
	on the VirtualGL server, then VGL will default to using __sr__
	compression.  VGL will fall back to using __proxy__ compression if, for
	any given frame, it is unable to send the frame using the Sun Ray Image
	Transport.  This could occur if, for example, the Sun Ray client is on
	a network that is not visible to the VirtualGL server.
	{nl}{nl} \
	If the X server is not a Sun Ray server but the ''DISPLAY'' environment
	variable begins with '':'' or ''unix:'', then VirtualGL assumes that the
	X display connection is local and it defaults to using __proxy__
	compression.  Otherwise, it defaults to __jpeg__ compression.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_DISPLAY = ''__''{d}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-d ''__''{d}''__ |
| Summary | __''{d}''__ = the X display or GLP device to use for 3D rendering |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | :0 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If the VirtualGL server has multiple 3D graphics cards and you
	want the OpenGL rendering to be redirected to a display other than :0, then
	you can set ''VGL_DISPLAY=:1.0'' or whatever.  This could be used, for
	instance, to support many application instances on a beefy multi-pipe
	graphics server.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__GLP mode (Solaris/Sparc only):__
	{nl}{nl} \
	Setting this option to ''glp'' will enable GLP mode and use the first
	framebuffer device listed in ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' to
	perform 3D rendering.  You can also set this option to the
	pathname of a specific GLP device (example: ''/dev/fbs/jfb0''.)  See
	{ref prefix="Section ": GLP_Usage} for more details.

{anchor: VGL_FPS}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_FPS = ''__''{f}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-fps ''__''{f}''__ |
| Summary | Limit the client/server frame rate to __''{f}''__ frames/second, \
	where __''{f}''__ is a floating point number > 0.0 |
| Image Transports | VGL, X11 |
| Default Value | No limit |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: This option prevents VirtualGL from sending frames at a rate
	faster than the specified limit.  It can be used, for instance, as a crude
	way to control network bandwidth or CPU usage in multi-user environments
	where those resources are constrained.
	{nl}{nl} \
	If frame spoiling is disabled, then this effectively limits the server's 3D
	rendering frame rate as well.

{anchor: VGL_GAMMA}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_GAMMA = ''__''0 \| 1 \| {g}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-g'' / ''+g'' / ''-gamma ''__''{g}''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable gamma correction and specify gamma correction \
	factor |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | ''VGL_GAMMA=1'' on Solaris/Sparc VGL servers, \
	''VGL_GAMMA=0'' otherwise |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: "Gamma" refers to the relationship between the intensity of
	light which your computer's monitor is instructed to display and the
	intensity which it actually displays.  The curve is an exponential curve of
	the form __Y = X{^G}__, where X is between 0 and 1.  G is called the "gamma"
	of the monitor.  PC monitors and TV's usually have a gamma of around 2.2.
	{nl}{nl} \
		Some of the math involved in 3D rendering assumes a linear gamma \
		(G = 1.0), so technically speaking, 3D applications will not display with \
		mathematical correctness unless the pixels are "gamma corrected" to \
		counterbalance the non-linear response curve of the monitor.  But some \
		systems do not have any form of built-in gamma correction, and thus the \
		applications developed for such systems have usually been designed to \
		display properly without gamma correction.  Gamma correction involves \
		passing pixels through a function of the form __X = W{^1/G}__, where G \
		is the "gamma correction factor" and should be equal to the gamma of the \
		monitor.  So the final output is __Y = X{^G} = (W{^1/G}){^G} = W__, which \
		describes a linear relationship between the intensity of the pixels drawn \
		by the application and the intensity of the pixels displayed by the \
		monitor. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__''VGL_GAMMA=1'' or ''vglrun +g'' : Enable gamma correction with default \
			settings__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		This option tells VirtualGL to enable gamma correction using the best \
		available method.  If VirtualGL is remotely displaying to a Solaris/Sparc \
		X server which has gamma-corrected X visuals, then VGL will attempt to \
		assign one of these visuals to the application.  This causes the 3D \
		output of the application to be gamma corrected by the factor specified \
		in ''fbconfig'' on the client machine (default: 2.22.)  Otherwise, if the \
		X server does not have gamma-corrected X visuals or if the \
		gamma-corrected visuals it has do not match the application's needs, then \
		VirtualGL performs gamma correction internally and uses a default gamma \
		correction factor of 2.22.  This option emulates the default behavior of \
		OpenGL applications running locally on Sparc machines. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__''VGL_GAMMA=0'' or ''vglrun -g'' : Disable gamma correction__ \
		{nl}{nl} \
		This option tells VGL not to use gamma-corrected visuals, even if they are \
		available on the X server, and disables VGL's internal gamma correction \
		system as well.  This emulates the default behavior of OpenGL \
		applications running locally on Linux or Solaris/x86 machines. \
		{nl}{nl} \
		__''VGL_GAMMA=''__''{g}''__ or ''vglrun -gamma ''__''{g}''__ : Enable \
			VGL's internal gamma correction system with a gamma correction factor \
			of __''{g}'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If ''VGL_GAMMA'' is set to an arbitrary floating point value, then \
		VirtualGL performs gamma correction internally using the specified value \
		as the gamma correction factor.  You can also specify a negative \
		value to apply a "de-gamma" function.  Specifying a gamma correction \
		factor of G (where G < 0) is equivalent to specifying a gamma correction \
		factor of -1/G.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_GLLIB = ''__''{l}''__ |
| Summary | __''{l}''__ = the location of an alternate OpenGL library |
| Image Transports | All |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, VirtualGL loads the first OpenGL dynamic library
	that it finds in the dynamic linker path (usually ''/usr/lib/libGL.so.1'',
	''/usr/lib64/libGL.so.1'',  or ''/usr/lib/64/libGL.so.1''.)  You can use this
	setting to explicitly specify another OpenGL dynamic library to load.
	{nl}{nl} \
	You shouldn't need to muck with this unless something doesn't work.  However,
	this setting is necessary when using VirtualGL with
	[[chromium.txt#Chromium][Chromium]]. \

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_GUI = ''__''{k}''__ |
| Summary | __''{k}''__ = the key sequence used to pop up the VirtualGL \
	Configuration dialog, or ''none'' to disable the dialog |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | shift-ctrl-f9 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: VirtualGL will normally monitor an application's X event queue
	and pop up the VirtualGL Configuration dialog whenever ''CTRL-SHIFT-F9'' is
	pressed.  In the event that this interferes with a key sequence that the
	application is already using, then you can redefine the key sequence used to
	pop up the VirtualGL Configuration dialog by setting ''VGL_GUI'' to some
	combination of ''shift'', ''ctrl'', ''alt'', and one of ''f1, f2, ..., f12''.
	You can also set ''VGL_GUI'' to ''none'' to disable the configuration dialog
	altogether.  See {ref prefix="Chapter ": Config_Dialog} for more details.

{anchor: VGL_INTERFRAME}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_INTERFRAME = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Enable or disable interframe image comparison |
| Image Transports | Sun Ray, VGL |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The VGL and Sun Ray Image Transports will normally compare
	each frame with the previous frame and send only the portions of the image
	which have changed.  Setting ''VGL_INTERFRAME'' to ''0'' disables this
	behavior.
	{nl}{nl} \
	You shouldn't need to disable interframe comparison except in rare
	situations.  This setting was introduced in order to work around a specific
	interaction issue between VirtualGL and Pro/ENGINEER v3.  See 
	{ref prefix="Section ": Application_Recipes} for more information.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__When using the VGL Image Transport, interframe comparison is affected \
		by the ''VGL_TILESIZE'' option__

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_LOG = ''__''{l}''__ |
| Summary | Redirect all messages from VirtualGL to a log file specified by \
	__''{l}''__ |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Print all messages to stderr |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Setting this environment variable to the pathname of a log
	file on the VirtualGL server will cause VirtualGL to redirect all of its
	messages (including profiling and trace output) to the specified log file
	rather than to stderr.

{anchor: VGL_NPROCS}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_NPROCS = ''__''{n}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-np ''__''{n}''__ |
| Summary | __''{n}''__ = the number of CPUs to use for multi-threaded \
	compression, or ''0'' to automatically determine the optimal number of CPUs \
	to use |
| Image Transports | VGL |
| Default Value | 0 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The VGL Image Transport can divide the task of compressing
	each frame among multiple server CPUs.  This might speed up the overall
	throughput if the compression stage of the pipeline is the primary
	bottleneck.  The default behavior (equivalent to setting this option to
	''0'') is to use all but one of the available CPUs, up to a maximum of 3
	total:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__1P system:__ 1 CPU used{nl} \
	__2P system:__ 1 CPU used{nl} \
	__3P system:__ 2 CPUs used{nl} \
	__4P & larger:__ 3 CPUs used \
	{nl}{nl} \
  On a large multiprocessor system, the speedup is almost linear up to 3
	processors, but the algorithm scales very little past that point.  VirtualGL
	will not allow more than 4 processors total to be used for compression, nor
	will it allow you to set this parameter to a value greater than the number of
	processors in the system.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Multi-threaded compression is affected by the ''VGL_TILESIZE'' option__

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_PORT = ''__''{p}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-p ''__''{p}''__ |
| Summary | __''{p}''__ = the TCP port to use when connecting to the \
	VirtualGL Client |
| Image Transports | VGL |
| Default Value | Read from X property stored by VirtualGL Client |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The connection port for the VGL Image Transport is normally
	determined by reading an X property that ''vglclient'' stores on the X
	server, so don't override this unless you know what you're doing.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_PROFILE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-pr'' / ''+pr'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then VirtualGL will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print out the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipelines.
	{nl}{nl} \
	See {ref prefix="Chapter ": Perf_Measurement} for more details.

{anchor: VGL_PROGRESSIVE}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_PROGRESSIVE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-prog'' / ''+prog'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable sending a lossless (RGB) frame during periods \
	of inactivity |
| Image Transports | Sun Ray (DPCM) |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When Sun Ray DPCM compression is being used, enabling this
	option causes the Sun Ray Image Transport to send a lossless (RGB) frame
	during periods of inactivity.  This is useful in environments where both
	image quality and performance are	critical.  With progressive mode enabled,
	the image quality for the Sun Ray compressor can be set to a fairly low value
	to speed up rotate/pan/zoom operations, then when the rotate/pan/zoom is
	completed, VirtualGL will send a lossless frame that can be analyzed by the
	user in more detail.

{anchor: VGL_QUAL}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_QUAL = ''__''{q}''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-q ''__''{q}''__ |
| Summary | __''{q}''__ = the JPEG compression quality, 1 \<\= __''{q}''__ \<\= 100 |
| Image Transports | VGL (JPEG) |
| Default Value | 95 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: In digital images, "frequency" refers to how quickly the color
	changes between light and dark as you move either horizontally or vertically
	in the image.  Images with very sharp, bright features on a dark background,
	for instance, consist of both low- and high-frequency components, whereas
	images with smooth transitions between neighboring pixels contain only
	low-frequency components.  JPEG compression works by breaking down the image
	into its constituent frequencies and then throwing out the highest of these
	frequencies.  The JPEG image "quality" determines which frequencies are
	thrown out.  A JPEG quality of 1 throws out all but the lowest frequencies
	and thus produces a very impressionistic, but generally not very useful,
	compressed image.  A JPEG quality of 100 retains all frequencies in the
	original image (but, due to roundoff errors, is still not completely
	lossless.)
	{nl}{nl} \
	Because the human eye usually can't detect the highest frequencies in the
	image, and often because the image lacks those high-frequency elements to
	begin with, a sufficiently high JPEG quality setting can produce a
	"perceptually lossless" image.  A "perceptually lossless" image contains
	a small amount of mathematical error vs. the original image, but this error
	is so small that the human visual system cannot distinguish it (under normal
	circumstances.)  The threshold quality level at which JPEG compression
	becomes perceptually lossless is different for each image, but experiments
	with various visual difference benchmarks (such as
	[[http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/resources/hdr/vdp/][HDR-VDP]]) suggest that	a
	JPEG quality of 95 is sufficient to guarantee perceptual losslessness in the
	types of applications (volume visualization apps, in particular) where image
	quality is critical.  As with any benchmarks, Your Mileage May Vary.  If
	quality is of paramount concern, consider setting the JPEG quality to 100 or
	using RGB encoding.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_READBACK = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable VirtualGL's pixel pipelines |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: On rare occasions, it might be desirable to have VirtualGL
	redirect OpenGL rendering from an application into a Pbuffer but not
	automatically read back and send the rendered pixels.  Some applications have
	their own mechanisms for reading back the buffer, so setting
	''VGL_READBACK=0'' disables VirtualGL's readback mechanism and prevents
	duplication of effort.
	{nl}{nl} \
	This feature was developed initially to support running
	[[http://www.paraview.org/][ParaView]] in parallel using MPI.  ParaView/MPI
	normally uses MPI processes 1 through N as rendering servers, each drawing a
	portion of the geometry into a separate window on a separate X display.
	ParaView reads back these server windows and composites the pixels into the
	main application window, which is controlled by MPI process 0.  By creating a
	script which passes a different value of ''VGL_DISPLAY'' and ''VGL_READBACK''
	to each MPI process, it is possible to make all of the ParaView server
	processes render to off-screen buffers on different graphics cards while
	preventing VirtualGL from displaying any pixels except those generated by
	process 0.

{anchor: VGL_SPOIL}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_SPOIL = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-sp'' / ''+sp'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable frame spoiling |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Enabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: By default, VirtualGL will drop frames so as not to slow down
	the rendering rate of the server's graphics engine.  This should produce the
	best results with interactive applications, but frame spoiling should be
	turned off when running benchmarks or other non-interactive applications.
	Turning off frame spoiling will force one frame to be sent to the client on
	every end-of-frame event, and thus the frame rate reported by OpenGL
	benchmarks will accurately reflect the frame rate of VirtualGL's image
	pipeline (though, in X proxy environments, this may still not accurately
	reflect the frame rate seen by the user.  See
	{ref prefix="Section ": Frame_Spoiling}.)  Disabling frame spoiling also
	prevents non-interactive applications from wasting graphics resources by
	rendering frames that will never be seen.  With frame spoiling turned off,
	the 3D rendering pipeline behaves as if it is fill-rate limited to about 30
	or 40 Megapixels/second, the maximum throughput of the VirtualGL system on
	current CPUs.

| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-s'' / ''+s'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable SSL encryption of the VGL Image Transport |

| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Enabling this option causes the VGL Image Transport to be
	tunneled through a secure socket layer (SSL)

	quad-buffered stereo is not available, either because the client or the
	image transport does not support it, then fall back to using anaglyphic
	stereo.  Quad-buffered stereo requires the VGL Image Transport, and it also
	requires that client support OpenGL and have a 3D accelerator that supports

| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-samp ''__''gray \| 1x \| 2x \| 4x \| 8x \| 16x''__ |
| Summary | Specify the level of chrominance subsampling in the \
	JPEG and Sun Ray image compressors |
| Image Transports | Sun Ray (DPCM), VGL (JPEG) |
| Default Value | 1x for VGL Image Transport, 16x for Sun Ray Image Transport |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When an image is compressed using JPEG or using Sun Ray
	DPCM compression, each pixel in the image is first converted from RGB
	(Red/Green/Blue) to YUV.  An RGB pixel has three values that specify the
	amounts of red, green, and blue that make up the pixel's color.  A YUV pixel
	has three values that specify the overall brightness of the pixel (Y, or
	"luminance") and the overall color of the pixel (U and V, or "chrominance".)
	{nl}{nl} \
	Since the human eye is less sensitive to changes in color than it is to
	changes in brightness, the chrominance components for some of the pixels can
	be discarded without much noticeable loss in image quality.  This technique,
	called "chrominance subsampling", significantly reduces the size of the
	compressed image.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__1x__ = no chrominance subsampling

	else being equal, 2x subsampling generally reduces the image size by about
	20-25% when compared to no subsampling.{nl} \
	{nl} \
	__4x__ = discard the chrominance components for every other pixel along both
	the X and Y directions of the image (this is also known as "4:2:0" or "2:2"
	subsampling.)   All else being equal, 4x subsampling generally reduces the
	image size by about 35-40% when compared to no subsampling.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__8x__ = discard the chrominance components for 3 out of every 4 pixels along
	the image's X direction and half the pixels along the image's Y direction
	(this is also known as "4:1:0" or "4:2" subsampling.)  __This option is
	available only with Sun Ray DPCM compression.__
	{nl}{nl} \
	__16x__ = discard the chrominance components for 3 out of every 4 pixels
	along both the X and Y directions of the image (this is also known as "4:4"
	subsampling.)  __This option is available only with Sun Ray DPCM
	compression.__
	{nl}{nl} \
	__gray__ = discard all chrominance components.  This is useful when running
	applications (such as medical visualization applications) that are already
	generating grayscale images.  __This option is available only with JPEG
	compression.__
	{nl}{nl} \
	Subsampling artifacts are less noticeable with volume data, since it usually
	only contains 256 colors to begin with.  But narrow, aliased lines and other
	sharp features on a black background will tend to produce very noticeable
	artifacts when subsampling is enabled. \

{anchor: VGL_SYNC}
| Environment Variable | ''VGL_SYNC = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-sync'' / ''+sync'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable strict 2D/3D synchronization |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, VirtualGL's operation is asynchronous from the point
	of view of the application.  The application swaps the buffers or calls
	''glFinish()'' or ''glFlush()'' or ''glXWaitGL()'', and VirtualGL reads	back
	the framebuffer and sends the pixels to the client's display ... eventually.
	This will work fine for the vast majority of applications, but it does not
	strictly conform to the GLX spec.  Technically speaking, when an application
	calls ''glXWaitGL()'' or ''glFinish()'', it is well within its rights to
	expect the 3D image to be immediately available in the X window.
	Fortunately, very few applications actually do expect this, but on rare
	occasions, an application may try to use ''XGetImage()'' or other X11
	functions to obtain a bitmap of the pixels that were rendered by OpenGL.
	Enabling ''VGL_SYNC'' is a somewhat extreme measure that may be needed to
	make such applications work properly.  It was developed initially as a way to
	pass the GLX conformance suite (''conformx'', specifically), but at least one
	commercial application is known to require it as well (see
	[[#Application_Recipes][Application Recipes]].){nl}\
	{nl}\
	When ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled, every call to ''glFinish()'', ''glXWaitGL()'',
	and ''glXSwapBuffers()'' will cause the contents of the server's framebuffer
	to be read back and __synchronously__ drawn into the application's window
	__using the X11 Image Transport and no frame spoiling__.  The call to
	''glFinish()'', ''glXWaitGL()'', or ''glXSwapBuffers()'' will not return
	until VirtualGL has verified that the pixels have been delivered into the
	application's window.  As such, this mode can have potentially dire effects
	on performance when used with a remote X server.  It is thus strongly
	recommended that ''VGL_SYNC'' be used only in conjunction with an X proxy
	(such as TurboVNC) running on the same server as VirtualGL.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_TILESIZE = ''__''{t}''__ |
| Summary | __''{t}''__ = the image tile size (__''{t}''__ x __''{t}''__ pixels) \
	to use for multi-threaded compression and interframe comparison \
	(8 \<\= __''{t}''__ \<\= 1024) |
| Image Transports | VGL |
| Default Value | 256 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, the VGL Image Transport will divide an OpenGL window
	into equal-sized square tiles, compare each tile vs. the same tile in the
	previous frame, and compress & send only the tiles which have changed
	(assuming interframe comparison is enabled.)  The VGL Image Transport	will
	also divide up the task of compressing these tiles among the available CPUs
	in a round robin fashion, if multi-threaded compression is enabled
	(see [[#VGL_NPROCS][VGL_NPROCS]].)
	{nl}{nl} \
	There are several tradeoffs that must be considered when choosing a tile
	size:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Smaller tile sizes:__ \
	{list: \
		{item: Better parallel scalability} \
		{item: Worse compression efficiency} \
		{item: Better inter-frame optimization} \
		{item: Worse network efficiency}} \
	__Larger tile sizes:__ \
	{list: \
		{item: Worse parallel scalability} \
		{item: Better compression efficiency} \
		{item: Worse inter-frame optimization} \
		{item: Better network efficiency}} \
	{nl} \
	Smaller tiles can more easily be divided up among multiple CPUs, but they
	compress less efficiently (and less quickly) on an individual basis.  Using
	larger tiles can reduce traffic to the client by allowing the server to send
	only one frame update instead of many.  But on the flip side, using larger
	tiles decreases the chance that a tile will be unchanged from the previous
	frame.
	{nl}{nl} \
	256x256 was chosen as the default because, in experiments, it provided
	the best balance between scalability and efficiency on the platforms that
	VirtualGL supports.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_TRACE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-tr'' / ''+tr'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable tracing |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When tracing is enabled, VirtualGL will log all calls to the
	GLX and X11 functions it is intercepting, as well as the arguments, return
	values, and execution times for those functions.  This is useful when
	diagnosing interaction problems between VirtualGL and a particular OpenGL
	application.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_VERBOSE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| ''vglrun'' argument | ''-v'' / ''+v'' |
| Summary | Disable/enable verbose VirtualGL messages |
| Image Transports | All |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When in verbose mode, VirtualGL will reveal some of the
	decisions it makes behind the scenes, such as which code path it is using to
	compress images, which type of X11 drawing it is using, etc.  This can be
	helpful when diagnosing performance problems.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_X11LIB = ''__''{l}''__ |
| Summary | __''{l}''__ = the location of an alternate X11 library |
| Image Transports | All |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, VirtualGL loads the first X11 dynamic library that
	it finds in the dynamic linker path (usually ''/usr/lib/libX11.so.?'',
	''/usr/lib/64/libX11.so.?'', ''/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.?'', or
	''/usr/X11R6/lib64/libX11.so.?''.)  You can use this setting to
	explicitly specify another X11 dynamic library to load.
	{nl}{nl} \
	You shouldn't need to muck with this unless something doesn't work.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_XVENDOR = ''__''{v}''__ |
| Summary | __''{v}''__ = a fake X11 vendor string to return when the \
	application calls ''XServerVendor()'' |
| Image Transports | All |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Some applications expect ''XServerVendor()'' to return a
	particular value, which the application (sometimes erroneously) uses to
	figure out whether it's running locally or remotely.  This setting allows you
	to fool such applications into thinking they're running on a "local" X
	server rather than a remote connection.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_ZOOM_X = ''__''1 \| 2''__{nl} \
	''VGL_ZOOM_Y = ''__''1 \| 2''__ |
| Summary | Subsample all pixels by the specified factor |
| Image Transports | Sun Ray |
| Default Value | 1 |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Setting ''VGL_ZOOM_X=2'' causes the Sun Ray Image Transport
	to discard every other pixel along the X direction of the image.  Setting
	''VGL_ZOOM_Y=2'' does the same thing for the Y direction of the image.  This
	differs from ''VGL_SUBSAMP'' in that ''VGL_SUBSAMP'' discards only luminance
	components from the pixels it subsamples.  ''VGL_ZOOM_*'', on the other hand,
	discards the entire pixels.  The result is extremely grainy, so this option
	is generally only useful in conjunction with ''VGL_PROGRESSIVE''.

** Client Settings

These settings control the VirtualGL Client, which is used only with the VGL
Image Transport.  ''vglclient'' is normally launched automatically from
''vglconnect'' and should not require any further configuration except in
exotic circumstances.  These settings are meant only for advanced users or
those wishing to build additional infrastructure around VirtualGL.

| Environment Variable | ''VGLCLIENT_DRAWMODE = ''__''ogl \| x11''__ |
| ''vglclient'' argument | ''-gl'' / ''-x'' |
| Summary | Specify the method used to draw pixels into the application window |
| Default Value | ''ogl'' for Solaris/Sparc systems with 3D accelerators, \
	''x11'' otherwise |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If the client machine has a 3D accelerator, then it may be
	faster to draw pixels using OpenGL than using 2D (X11) commands.  This is
	particularly true of many 3D accelerators available for the Sparc platform,
	since they are able to draw images using 24-bit pixels instead of the 32-bit
	pixels required by the X server.

| Environment Variable | ''VGLCLIENT_LISTEN = ''__''sslonly \| nossl''__ |
| ''vglclient'' argument | ''-sslonly'' / ''-nossl'' |
| Summary | Accept only unencrypted or only SSL connections from the \
	VirtualGL server |
| Default Value | Accept both SSL and unencrypted connections |
#OPT: hiCol=first

{nl}

| Environment Variable | ''VGLCLIENT_PORT = ''__''{p}''__ |
| ''vglclient'' argument | ''-port ''__''{p}''__ |
| Summary | __''{p}''__ = TCP port on which to listen for unencrypted \
	connections from the VirtualGL server |
| Default Value | Automatically select a free port |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The default behavior for ''vglclient'' is to first try
	listening on port	4242, to maintain backward compatibility with VirtualGL
	v2.0.x.  If port 4242 is not available, then ''vglclient'' will try to find
	a free port in the range of 4200-4299.  If none of those ports is available,
	then ''vglclient'' will request a free port from the operating system.
	{nl}{nl} \
	Passing this argument to ''vglclient'' circumvents the automatic behavior
	described above and causes ''vglclient'' to listen only on the specified TCP
	port.  Don't do this unless you know what you're doing.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_PROFILE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then VirtualGL will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print out the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipelines.
	{nl}{nl} \
	See {ref prefix="Chapter ": Perf_Measurement} for more details.

| Environment Variable | ''VGLCLIENT_SSLPORT = ''__''{p}''__ |
| ''vglclient'' argument | ''-sslport ''__''{p}''__ |
| Summary | __''{p}''__ = TCP port on which to listen for SSL \
	connections from the VirtualGL server |
| Default Value | Automatically select a free port |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: The default behavior for ''vglclient'' is to first try
	listening on port	4243, to maintain backward compatibility with VirtualGL
	v2.0.x.  If port 4243 is not available, then ''vglclient'' will try to find
	a free port in the range of 4200-4299.  If none of those ports is available,
	then ''vglclient'' will request a free port from the operating system.
	{nl}{nl} \
	Passing this argument to ''vglclient'' circumvents the automatic behavior
	described above and causes ''vglclient'' to listen only on the specified TCP
	port.  Don't do this unless you know what you're doing.

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_VERBOSE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable verbose VirtualGL messages |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: When in verbose mode, VirtualGL will reveal some of the
	decisions it makes behind the scenes, such as which code path it is using to
	decompress images, which type of X11 drawing it is using, etc.  This can be
	helpful when diagnosing performance problems.
