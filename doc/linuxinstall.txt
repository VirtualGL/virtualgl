* Installing the VirtualGL Server and Direct Mode Client on Linux

	!!! Installing the VirtualGL package is necessary on any Linux machine that
	will act as a VirtualGL server or as a VirtualGL
	[[overview.txt#Direct_Mode][Direct Mode]]	client.  It is not necessary to
	install VirtualGL on the client machine if
	[[overview.txt#Raw_Mode][Raw Mode]] is to be used.

*** Installing TurboJPEG
#OPT: noList! plain!

	1. Obtain the latest TurboJPEG RPM from the "Files" area of
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl]].
		!!! .tgz packages are provided for users of non-RPM platforms.  You can
		use [[http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/][alien]] to convert these into
		.deb packages if you prefer.

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the RPM package,
		and issue the following command:
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -Uvh turbojpeg*.rpm
		---

*** Installing VirtualGL
#OPT: noList! plain!

	1. If you are using RedHat/CentOS Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, or 4 or SuSE
		Linux 9, obtain one of the pre-built VirtualGL RPMs from the files area of
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl]].
		{nl}{nl}
		The Enterprise Linux 2.1 RPM should (theoretically) also work with RedHat
			Linux 7.2 and 7.3 (and maybe 7.1 if patched.){nl}
		The Enterprise Linux 3 RPM should (theoretically) also work with RedHat
			Linux 8 (patched), RedHat Linux 9, and Fedora Core 1 & 2.{nl}
		The Enterprise Linux 4 RPM should (theoretically) also work with Fedora
			Core 3 & 4.{nl}
		The SuSE Linux 9 RPM should (theoretically) also work with SuSE 10.

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the RPM package,
		and issue the following command:
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -Uvh VirtualGL*.rpm
		---

*** Installing VirtualGL from Source
#OPT: noList! plain!

If you are using an RPM-based distribution of Linux but there isn't a pre-built
VirtualGL RPM that matches your distribution, then you can build your own RPM
using the VirtualGL Source RPM (SRPM.)

	1. Obtain the VirtualGL SRPM from the files area of
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl]].

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the SRPM, and
		issue the following commands:
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -i VirtualGL*.src.rpm
		cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
		rpmbuild -ba virtualgl.spec
		---
		!!! On SuSE, cd to ''/usr/src/packages/SPECS'' instead.  Some versions of
		SuSE symlink this to ''/usr/src/redhat/SPECS''.

	3. Sit back and watch the fun.

	4. If the build completes successfully, it will produce a binary RPM in
		''/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/{your_cpu_architecture}'' (or
		''/usr/src/packages/RPMS/{your_cpu_architecture})'', which you can install
		using the instructions from the previous section.

If you are using a non-RPM based distribution of Linux, then log in as root,
download the VirtualGL source tarball from the files area of
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl]], uncompress it, ''cd vgl'', and
type ''make install''.  Refer to ''BUILDING.txt'' in the source directory for
further details.

*** NVidia driver permissions
#OPT: noList! plain!

If installing VirtualGL on a server which is running version 1.0-71xx or
earlier of the NVidia accelerated GLX drivers, follow the instructions in
''/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README'' regarding setting the appropriate
permissions for ''/dev/nvidia*''.  This is not necessary with more recent
versions of the driver.

** Granting VirtualGL Access to the Server's X Display

VirtualGL requires access to the server's 3D graphics card so that it can
create off-screen pixel buffers (Pbuffers) and redirect the 3D rendering
from applications into these Pbuffers.  Unfortunately, accessing a 3D
graphics card on Linux currently requires going through an X server.  So the
only way to share the server’s 3D graphics resources among multiple users is to
grant those users display access to the X server that is running on the shared
3D graphics card.

It is important to understand the security risks associated with this.  Once
X display access is granted to a user, there is nothing preventing that user
from logging keystrokes or reading back images from the X display.  Using
''xauth'', one can obtain “untrusted” X authentication keys which prevent such
exploits, but unfortunately, those untrusted keys also disallow access to the
3D hardware.  So it is necessary to grant full trusted X access to any users
that will need to run VirtualGL.  Unless you fully trust the users to whom you
are granting this access, you should avoid logging in locally to the server’s
X display as root unless absolutely necessary.  Even then, it’s probably a good
idea to make sure that there are no suspicious-looking processes running on the
system prior to logging in.

This section will explain how to configure a VirtualGL server such that select
users can run VirtualGL, even if the server is sitting at the login prompt.
The basic idea is to call a script (''vglgenkey'') from the display manager's
startup script.  ''vglgenkey'' invokes ''xauth'' to generate an authorization
key for the server's X display, and it stores this key under
''/etc/opt/VirtualGL''.  The VirtualGL launcher script (''vglrun'') then
attempts to read this key and merge it into the user's ''.Xauthority'' file,
thus granting the user access to the server's X display.  Therefore, you can
control who has access to the server's X display simply by controlling who has
read access to the ''/etc/opt/VirtualGL'' directory.

If you prefer, you can also grant access to every authenticated user on the
server by replacing the references to ''vglgenkey'' below with
''xhost +localhost''.

	#. If the server machine is configured to boot into runlevel 5 (graphical
		login), then temporarily shut down its X server by issuing

		#Verb <<---
		init 3
		---

		as root

	#. Log in as root from the text console.

	#. Create a new group called ''vglusers'' and add any users that need to
		run VirtualGL to this group.

	#. Create a new directory ''/etc/opt/VirtualGL'' and make it readable by the
		''vglusers'' group, e.g.:

		#Verb: <<---
		mkdir -p /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chgrp vglusers /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		chmod 750 /etc/opt/VirtualGL
		---

	#. If the server machine is configured to boot into runlevel 3 (text login),
		then configure it to boot into a graphical login by changing the first line
		of ''/etc/inittab'' from{nl}
		{nl}
		''id:3:initdefault:''{nl}
		{nl}
		to{nl}
		{nl}
		''id:5:initdefault:''

	#. Add

		#Verb <<---
		vglgenkey
		---

		at the top of the display manager's startup script.  The location of
		this script varies depending on the particular Linux distribution and
		display manager being used.  The following table lists some common
		locations for this file:
		{nl}{nl}
		|| || xdm or kdm || gdm{nl}{,(default display manager on most Linux systems)} ||
		| RedHat 7/8/9{nl}Enterprise Linux 2.1/3 \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0''{nl} \
			{nl} \
			(replace "0" with the display number of the X server you are \
			configuring) \
		| ''/etc/X11/gdm/Init/Default''{nl} \
			{nl} \
			(usually this is just symlinked to ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0'') \
		|
		| Enterprise Linux 4{nl}Fedora Core 1/2/3 \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0''{nl} \
			{nl} \
			(replace "0" with the display number of the X server you are \
			configuring) \
		| ''/etc/X11/gdm/Init/:0''{nl} \
			{nl} \
			(usually this is just symlinked to ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0'') \
		|
		| SuSE/United Linux \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup'' \
		| ''/etc/opt/gnome/gdm/Init/Default'' \
		|
		#OPT: hiCol=first, align=center

	#. If the server is running gdm (the factory default on most Linux systems),
		then you'll need to set up gdm to allow TCP connections to the X server.
		To do this, edit the ''gdm.conf'' file and add the following line under the
		''[security]'' section (or change it if it already exists):

		#Verb <<---
		DisallowTCP=false
		---

		See the table below for the location of gdm.conf on various systems.

	#. Unless you know that you absolutely need it, disable the XTEST extension.
		Disabling XTEST will not prevent a user from logging keystrokes or reading
		images from the X display, but it will prevent them from inserting
		key and mouse events and thus hijacking a local X session.{nl}
		{nl}
		Disabling XTEST is accomplished by passing an argument of ''-tst'' on the
		command line used to launch the X server.  The location of this command
		line varies depending on the particular Linux distribution and display
		manager being used.   The following table lists some common locations:{nl}
		{nl}
		|| || xdm || gdm{nl}{,(default on most Linux systems)} || kdm ||
		| RedHat (or equivalent) \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers'' \
		| ''/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf'' \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers'' \
		|
		| SuSE/United Linux \
		| ''/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers'' \
		| ''/etc/opt/gnome/gdm/gdm.conf'' \
		| ''/etc/opt/kde3/share/config/kdm/Xservers'' \
		|
		#OPT: hiCol=first, align=center
		{nl}
		For xdm-style configuration files, add ''-tst'' to the line corresponding to
		the display number you are configuring, e.g.:
	
		#Verb <<---
		:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 vt07 -tst
		---
	
		For gdm-style configuration files, add ''-tst'' to all lines that appear to
		be X server command lines, e.g.:
	
		#Verb <<---
		StandardXServer=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -tst
		---
		#Verb <<---
		[server-Standard]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -tst -audit 0
		---
		#Verb <<---
		[server-Terminal]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -tst -audit 0 -terminate
		---
		#Verb <<---
		[server-Chooser]
		command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -tst -audit 0
		---

	#. Restart the X server by issuing
		#Verb <<---
		init 5
		---
		as root.

	#. You can check your work by running
		#Verb <<---
		xauth merge /etc/opt/VirtualGL/vgl_xauth_key
		xdpyinfo -display :0
		---
		In particular, make sure that XTEST doesn't show up in the list of
		extensions if you disabled it above.  If ''xdpyinfo'' fails to run, then
		the permissions on Display :0 are probably still too restrictive, meaning
		that the change in Step 6 didn't take for some reason.

** Automatically Starting the VirtualGL Client

The VirtualGL Direct Mode client for Linux can be configured to start
automatically whenever an X Windows session starts.  To do this, run

#Verb: <<---
vglclient_config -install
---

as root.

Depending on your system configuration, this script will either tweak the
''/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc'' file or create a link in
''/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d'' so that the VirtualGL client will be automatically
started whenever any X Windows session is started.  Running
''vglclient_config -install'' also adds a line to
''/etc/X11/gdm/PostSession/Default'' (or the equivalent for your system) to
terminate the client whenever you log out of the X Windows session.  This is
known to work on RedHat- and SuSE-compatible platforms that use the Gnome
Display Manager (gdm.)  It probably won't work on other distributions and
display managers.

To remove the auto-start feature, run

#Verb: <<---
vglclient_config -remove
---

as root.

If ''vglclient_config'' doesn't work on your system, then you can edit the
appropriate X11 session files so that

#Verb: <<---
/usr/bin/vglclient_daemon start
---

runs whenever an X session starts and

#Verb: <<---
/usr/bin/vglclient_daemon stop
---

runs whenever the session terminates.

''vglclient_daemon'' will only start ''vglclient'' if it is not already
running, so starting the client in this manner guarantees that there will
never be more than one copy of it running on the system.  ''vglclient_daemon''
should work on any Linux platform that conforms to the Linux Standard Base
(LSB.)

If additional X displays are started by the same user (:1, :2, etc.), this will
not cause additional VirtualGL client instances to start.  Only one VirtualGL
client instance is needed to talk to all active displays.  However, it is
important to note that all active displays on the client machine need to be
running under the same user privileges as the VirtualGL client, or they need to
grant permissions to localhost (''xhost +localhost'') so that the VirtualGL
client can access them.

If you wish to change the default port that the client listens on, you will
need to edit ''/usr/bin/vglclient_daemon'' and pass the appropriate argument
(''-port <port number>'' or ''-sslport <port number>'') on the ''vglclient''
command line located in that file.  By default, the client will listen on port
4242 for unencrypted connections and port 4243 for SSL connections.

** Uninstalling

As root, issue the following command:

#Verb: <<---
rpm -e VirtualGL
---
