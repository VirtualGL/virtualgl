** Linux/Itanium

VirtualGL should build and run on Itanium Linux, but it has not been thoroughly
tested.  [[http://sourceforge.net/users/dcommander][Contact us]] if you
encounter any difficulties.

** Solaris/x86

|| || Server || Client ||

#OPT: hiCol=first

	!!! * mediaLib is pre-installed on Solaris 10/x86 and higher, but it is
	strongly recommended that you download and install the mediaLib 2.5 upgrade
	from the link above.  mediaLib 2.5 improves the performance of VirtualGL
	significantly on Solaris/x86 systems, when compared to the pre-installed
	version of mediaLib.

#OPT: hiCol=first

	!!! * Exceed 2008 contains a serious bug which, as of this writing, has not
	been resolved.  It prevents the VirtualGL Client from working	properly unless
	the MIT-SHM X extension is disabled, and disabling this extension severely
	impacts the performance of VirtualGL.
