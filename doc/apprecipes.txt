|| Application || Platform || Recipe || Notes ||
| ANSA v12.1.0 | Linux/x86 \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''LD_PRELOAD_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD''{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD='' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of the ''ansa.sh'' script, then add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD_SAVE'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		just prior to the ''${ANSA_EXEC_DIR}bin/ansa_linux${ext2}'' line. \
	| The ANSA startup script directly invokes ''/lib/libc.so.6'' to query \
		the glibc version.  Since the VirtualGL faker depends on libc, preloading \
		VirtualGL when directly invoking ''libc.so.6'' creates an infinite loop. \
		So it is necessary to disable the preloading of VirtualGL in the \
		application script and then re-enable it prior to launching the actual \
		application. \

| Army Ops | Linux/x86 \
	| ''vglrun -dl armyops'' \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| AutoForm v4.0x | All \
	| ''vglrun +sync xaf_''__''{version}''__ \
	| AutoForm relies on mixed X11/OpenGL rendering, and thus certain features \
		(particularly the "Dynamic Section" dialog and "Export Image" feature) do \
		not work properly unless ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled.  Since ''VGL_SYNC'' \
		automatically enables the X11 image transport and disables frame \
		spoiling, it is highly recommended that you use TurboVNC when \
		''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled.  See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SYNC} for more \
		details. \
	|
| Cedega v6.0.x | Linux \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of ''~/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-{version}/bin/winex3'', then \
		run Cedega as you would normally (without ''vglrun''.)  Since ''vglrun'' \
		is not being used, it is necessary to use environment variables or the \
		VirtualGL Configuration dialog to modify VirtualGL's configuration. \
	| The actual binary (WineX) which uses OpenGL is buried beneath several \
		layers of Python and shell scripts.  The ''LD_PRELOAD'' variable does not \
		get propagated down from the initial shell that invoked ''vglrun''. \

	| ''vglrun descent3 -g /usr/lib/librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		or \
		{nl}{nl} \

	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| Doom 3 | Linux/x86 	 \
	| ''vglrun doom3 +set r_glDriver /usr/lib/librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		or \

		''vglrun -dl doom3'' \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| Enemy Territory (Return to Castle Wolfenstein) | Linux/x86 \
	| ''vglrun et +set r_glDriver /usr/lib/librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \

		''vglrun -dl et'' \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \

| Heretic II | Linux/x86 \
	| ''vglrun heretic2 +set gl_driver /usr/lib/librrfaker.so +set vid_ref glx'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		or \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''vglrun -dl heretic2 +set vid_ref glx'' \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| Heavy Gear II | Linux/x86 \
	| ''vglrun hg2 -o /usr/lib/librrfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		or \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''vglrun -dl hg2'' \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| HyperWorks v8 (Altair) | Linux/x86-64 \
	| ''vglrun -dl ''__''{application script}''__ \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details. \
	|
| I-deas Master Series 9, 10, & 11 | Solaris/Sparc \
	| When running I-deas with VirtualGL on a Solaris/Sparc server, remotely \
		displaying to a non-Sparc client machine or to an X proxy such as VNC, \
		it may be necessary to set the ''SDRC_SUN_IGNORE_GAMMA'' environment \
		variable to ''1''. \
	| I-deas normally aborts if it detects that the X visual assigned to it is \
		not gamma-corrected.  But gamma-corrected X visuals only exist on \
		Solaris/Sparc X servers, so if you are displaying the application to \
		another type of X server or X proxy which doesn't provide gamma-corrected \
		X visuals, then it is necessary to override the gamma detection mechanism \
		in I-deas. \
	|
| Java2D applications that use OpenGL | Linux, Solaris \
	| Java2D will use OpenGL to perform its rendering if ''sun.java2d.opengl'' \
		is set to ''True''.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		In order for this to work in VirtualGL, it is necessary to invoke \
		''vglrun'' with the ''-dl'' switch.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''vglrun -dl java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If you are using Java v6 b92 or later, you can also set the environment \
		variable ''J2D_ALT_LIBGL_PATH'' to the path of ''librrfaker.so''.  For example: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''setenv J2D_ALT_LIBGL_PATH /opt/VirtualGL/lib/librrfaker.so''{nl} \
		''vglrun java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=True MyAppClass'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
	| See {ref prefix="Chapter ": dlopen} for more details \
	|
| Java2D applications that use OpenGL | Solaris/Sparc \
	| When VirtualGL is used in conjunction with Java v5.0 (also known as Java \
		1.5.0) to remotely display Java2D applications using the OpenGL pipeline \
		(see above), certain Java2D applications will cause the OpenGL subsystem \
		to crash with the following error: \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''thread tries to access GL context current to another thread'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		If you encounter this error, try setting the ''SUN_OGL_IS_MT'' environment \
		variable to ''1'' and re-running the application. \
	| Java 5.0 should call ''glXInitThreadsSUN()'' since it is using multiple \
		OpenGL threads, but it doesn't.  Purely by chance, this doesn't cause any \
		problems when the application is displayed locally.  But VirtualGL \
		changes things up enough that the luck runs out.  This issue does not \
		exist in Java 6. \
	|
| Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire v2.0 | Solaris/Sparc \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''graphics opengl'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to ''~/config.pro''.  You may also need to set the ''VGL_XVENDOR'' \
		environment variable to ''"Sun Microsystems, Inc."'' if you are running \
		Pro/ENGINEER 2.0 over a remote X connection to a Linux or Windows \
		VirtualGL client. \
	|	Pro/E 2.0 for Solaris will disable OpenGL if it detects a remote \
		connection to a non-Sun X server. \
	|
| QGL (OpenGL Qt Widget) | Linux \
	| ''vglrun -dl {application}'' \
	| Qt can be built such that it either resolves symbols from libGL \
		automatically or uses ''dlopen()'' to manually resolve those symbols \
		from libGL.  As of Qt v3.3, the latter behavior is the default, so \
		OpenGL programs built with later versions of libQt will not work with \
		VirtualGL unless the ''-dl'' switch is used with ''vglrun''. \
