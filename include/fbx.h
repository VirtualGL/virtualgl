  fb = Address of fbx_struct (must be pre-allocated by user)
  wh = Handle to the window that you wish to read from or write to.  On
       Windows, this is the same as the HWND.  On Unix, this is a struct
       (see above) that describes the X11 display and drawable you wish to use.
       If wh.v is non-NULL, then FBX assumes that the drawable is a Pixmap.
  width = Width of buffer (in pixels) that you wish to create.  0 = use width
          of window
  height = Height of buffer (in pixels) that you wish to create.  0 = use
           height of window
  useShm = Use MIT-SHM extension, if available (Unix only.)

  NOTES:
  -- fbx_init() is idempotent.  If you call it multiple times, it will
     re-initialize the buffer only when it is necessary to do so (such as when
     the window size has changed.)
  -- On Windows, fbx_init() will return a buffer configured with the same pixel
     format as the screen, unless the screen depth is < 24 bits, in which case
     it will always return a 32-bit BGRA buffer.

  On return, fbx_init() fills in the following relevant information in the
  fbx_struct that you passed to it:

  fb->format = pixel format of the buffer (one of FBX_RGB, FBX_RGBA, FBX_BGR,
               FBX_BGRA, FBX_ABGR, or FBX_ARGB)
  fb->width, fb->height = dimensions of the buffer
  fb->pitch = bytes in each scanline of the buffer
