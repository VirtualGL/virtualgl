* Using VirtualGL with Other X Proxies
{anchor: X11_Proxy_Usage}

The [[turbovncusage.txt#TurboVNC_Usage][previous chapter]] described how to use
VirtualGL with TurboVNC, but much of this information is also applicable to
other X proxies, such as RealVNC, NX, etc.  Generally, none of these other
solutions will provide anywhere near the performance of TurboVNC, but some of
them have capabilities that TurboVNC lacks (NX, for instance, can do seamless
windows.)

VirtualGL reads the value of the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable to
determine whether to enable the X11 Transport by default.  If ''DISPLAY''
begins with a colon ("'':''") or with "''unix:''", then VirtualGL will assume
that the X server connection is local and will enable the X11 Transport as the
default.  This should effectively make the X11 Transport the default for most X
proxies, but if for some reason that doesn't occur, then you can force the use
of the X11 Transport by setting the ''VGL_COMPRESS'' environment variable to
''proxy'' on the application server or passing an argument of ''-c proxy'' to
''vglrun''.
