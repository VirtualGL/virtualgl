* Using VirtualGL in Raw Mode with TurboVNC
{anchor: Raw_Mode_Usage}

Referring to {ref prefix="Section ": Overview}, Raw Mode is a mode in
which VirtualGL bypasses its internal image compressor and instead sends the
rendered 3D images to an X server as uncompressed bitmaps.  Raw Mode is
designed to be used with an "X Proxy", which is a virtual X server that
intercepts X-Windows commands from an application, renders them into images,
compresses the images, and sends them over the network to a client.

Thus, in Raw Mode, VirtualGL relies on the X proxy to compress the rendered
3D images, and since VirtualGL is sending those images to the X proxy at a
very fast rate, the proxy must be able to compress the images very quickly in
order to keep up.  But, unfortunately, most X proxies can't.  They simply
aren't designed for the types of full-screen video workloads that VirtualGL
generates.  Therefore, the VirtualGL Project provides an optimized X proxy
known as TurboVNC, which is based on the
[[http://www.realvnc.com/][Virtual Network Computing (VNC)]] standard (more
specifically, on the [[http://www.tightvnc.com][TightVNC]] variant thereof.)

On the surface, TurboVNC behaves very similarly to its parent project, but 
TurboVNC has been tuned to provide interactive performance for the types of
full-screen video workloads that VirtualGL produces.  On these types of image
workloads, TurboVNC performs as much as an order of magnitude faster than
TightVNC, uses more than an order of magnitude less CPU time to compress each
frame, and it produces comparable compression ratios.  Part of this speedup
comes from the use of TurboJPEG, the same high-speed vector-optimized JPEG
codec used by VirtualGL.  Another large part of the speedup comes from
bypassing the color compression features of TightVNC.  TightVNC performs very
CPU-intensive analysis on each image tile to determine whether the tile will
compress better using color compression or JPEG.  But for the types of images
that a 3D application generates, it is almost never the case that color
compression compresses better than JPEG, so TurboVNC bypasses this analysis to
improve performance.  TurboVNC also has the ability to hide network latency by
decompressing and drawing a frame on the client while the next frame is being
fetched from the server, thus improving performance dramatically on high-latency
connections.  TurboVNC additionally provides client-side double buffering, full
support for Solaris, and other tweaks.

There are several reasons why one might prefer to use Raw Mode + TurboVNC over
Direct Mode (and several reasons why one might not.)

*** Advantages of Raw Mode + TurboVNC
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* TurboVNC eliminates the need to send X11 traffic over the network, thus
		it performs very well on low-bandwidth, high-latency connections (such as
		broadband or long-haul T1 lines.)  The application GUI will load and render
		much faster (perhaps even orders of magnitude faster) with TurboVNC
		than with Direct Mode on such connections.

	* TurboVNC provides rudimentary collaboration capabilities.  Multiple clients
		can simultaneously view the same server session and pass around control of
		the keyboard and mouse.

	* The TurboVNC client is stateless.  If the network hiccups or the client is
		otherwise disconnected, the session remains running on the server and can
		be rejoined from any machine on the network.

	* No X server is required on the client machine.  This reduces the deployment
		cost and complexity for Windows clients.

	* TurboVNC is generally easier to set up and use.

*** Advantages of Direct Mode
#OPT: noList! plain!

	* Direct Mode performs significantly faster (generally about 25-30% faster)
		than TurboVNC on local-area networks.

	* Direct Mode provides seamless windows, whereby each application window
		appears as a separate window on the user's desktop.  TurboVNC, on the other
		hand, displays the entire virtual desktop in a single window, which does
		not create a seamless experience.

	* Direct Mode consumes fewer server CPU resources.  TurboVNC will generally
		require about 20% more server CPU cycles to maintain the same frame rate
		as Direct Mode, both because it has to compress more pixels in each frame
		(an entire desktop rather than a single window) and because it has to
		perform 2D (X11) rendering as well as 3D rendering.  In Direct Mode, the
		2D (X11) rendering is offloaded to the client machine.

	* Direct Mode supports stereographic rendering and transparent overlays.

** Using Raw Mode When TurboVNC and VirtualGL Are Running on the Same Machine

#OPT fmt=latex: w=4cm

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window on your client machine.

	#. In the new Command Prompt/terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSh)
		session into the VirtualGL/TurboVNC server machine by typing:

		#Verb: <<---
		ssh {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace ''{user}'' with your user account name on the VirtualGL server and
		''{server}'' with the hostname or IP address of that server.

		!!! If using PuTTY, replace ''ssh'' with ''putty'' in the above example.

	#. In the SSh session, start a TurboVNC server session:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver
		---

		Solaris server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vncserver
		---

	#. Make a note of the X display number that the TurboVNC server process
		prints out, for instance:
		{nl}{nl}
		''New 'X' desktop is my_server:1''
		{nl}{nl}
		If this is the first time that a TurboVNC server session has ever been run
		under this user account, TurboVNC will prompt for a VNC session password.

	#. The SSh session can now be exited, if desired.

	#. On the client machine, start the TurboVNC Viewer.

		Linux clients :: {:}
		Open a terminal and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Solaris clients :: {:}
		Open a terminal and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		Select __TurboVNC Viewer__ in the __TurboVNC__ Start Menu group.

	#. A small dialog box will appear.
		{nl}{nl}
		|| Windows TurboVNC viewer || Linux/Solaris TurboVNC viewer ||
		| {img:turbovnc1.png} | {img:turbovnc2.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the X display name (hostname/IP address and display number) of the
		TurboVNC server in the "VNC Server" field, then click "Connect" (Windows)
		or press Enter (Linux/Solaris.)

	#. Another dialog box appears, prompting for the VNC session password.
		{nl}{nl}
		|| Windows TurboVNC viewer || Linux/Solaris TurboVNC viewer ||
		| {img:turbovnc3.png} | {img:turbovnc4.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the TurboVNC session password and click "OK" (Windows) or press
		Enter (Linux/Solaris.)
		{nl}{nl}
		A TurboVNC desktop window should appear on your client machine.  This
		window contains a virtual X server with which you can interact to launch
		X-Windows applications on the TurboVNC server machine.

	#. Open a new terminal inside the TurboVNC desktop.

	#. In the terminal, start the 3D application using VirtualGL:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---
		Solaris server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWvgl/bin/vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

	Consult {ref prefix="Section ": Advanced_Configuration} for more
	information on ''vglrun'' command line options.

** Using Raw Mode When TurboVNC and VirtualGL Are Running on Different Machines

#IMG: rawmodeoverservernetwork.png
#OPT fmt=latex: w=4cm

If TurboVNC and VirtualGL are running on different servers, then it is
desirable to use Raw Mode to send images from the VirtualGL server to the
TurboVNC server.  Otherwise, the images would have to be compressed by the
VirtualGL server, decompressed by the VirtualGL client, then recompressed by
the TurboVNC server, which is a waste of CPU resources.  However, sending
images uncompressed over a network requires a fast network (generally, Gigabit
Ethernet or faster.)  So there needs to be a fast link between the VirtualGL
server and the TurboVNC server for this procedure to perform well.

The procedure for using Raw Mode to transmit images from a VirtualGL server
to a TurboVNC server is essentially the same as the procedure for using Direct
Mode with a [[directmodeusage.txt#Direct_X11_Connection][Direct X11 Connection]]
-- with the following notable differences:

	#. The "client" in this case is really the TurboVNC server machine.

	#. The "X server" is really the TurboVNC server session.

	#. It is not necessary to start the VirtualGL client.

	#. Once connected to the VirtualGL server via. SSh, it is necessary to either
		set the environment variable ''VGL_COMPRESS'' to ''0'' or pass an argument
		of ''-c 0'' to ''vglrun'' when launching VirtualGL.  Otherwise, VirtualGL
		will detect that the connection to the X server is remote, and it will
		automatically try to enable Direct Mode.  Setting ''VGL_COMPRESS'' to ''0''
		forces the use of Raw Mode, regardless of whether the X server is local or
		remote.

** Disconnecting and Killing the TurboVNC Session

Closing the TurboVNC viewer disconnects from the TurboVNC server session, but
the TurboVNC server session (and any applications that you may have started in
it) is still running on the server machine, and you can reconnect to it at any
time.

To kill a TurboVNC server session:

	#. Log in to the TurboVNC server using SSh.

	#. Type the following command:

		Linux server :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :{n}
		---

		Solaris :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/SUNWtvnc/bin/vncserver -kill :{n}
		---

	Replace ''{n}'' with the X display number of the TurboVNC server session you
	wish to kill.

To list the X display numbers and process ID's of all TurboVNC server sessions
that are currently running under your user account on this machine, run

	Linux server :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list
	---

	Solaris server :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/SUNWtvnc/bin/vncserver -list
	---

** Using TurboVNC in a Web Browser

When a TurboVNC server session is created, it automatically launches a
miniature web server that serves up a Java TurboVNC viewer applet.  This Java
TurboVNC viewer can be used to connect to the TurboVNC server from a machine
that does not have a native TurboVNC viewer installed (or a machine for which
no native TurboVNC viewer is available.)  The Java viewer is significantly
slower than the native viewer on high-speed networks, but on low-speed networks
the Java viewer and native viewers have comparable performance.  The Java
viewer does not currently support double buffering.

To use the Java TurboVNC viewer, point your web browser to:

''http://turbovnc_server:{5800+n}''

where ''{turbovnc_server}'' is the hostname or IP address of the TurboVNC
server machine, and ''n'' is the X display number of the TurboVNC server
session to which you want to connect.

__Example:__
If the TurboVNC server is running on X display ''my_server:1'', then point
your web browser to:

''http://my_server:5801''

** Connection Profiles: Optimizing TurboVNC's Performance for Different Network Types

To get the peak performance out of TurboVNC, you must give it a hint about
the type of network that separates your client machine from the TurboVNC
server.  To do this, select a Connection Profile when launching the TurboVNC
viewer.

In the Windows TurboVNC viewer, there are three buttons in the TurboVNC
Connection dialog box that allow you to easily select the connection profile.
In the Java viewer, the same thing is accomplished by clicking the "Options"
button at the top of the browser window.  With the Linux/Solaris TurboVNC
viewer, you can either use command line options to set the connection profile
prior to connecting, or you can press the F8 key after connecting to pop up
a menu from which you can select the connection profile.

|| || Linux/Solaris TurboVNC viewer || Windows & Java TurboVNC viewers ||
| High-bandwidth, low-latency network \
	| No action necessary \
	| Select "High-Speed Network" Connection Profile. \
	|
| Low-bandwidth, high-latency network (favor performance over image quality) \
	| Pass argument of ''-broadband'' to ''vncviewer'' or select \
		"Preset: Broadband (favor performance)" from the F8 popup menu \
	| Select "Broadband (favor performance)" Connection Profile. \
	|
| Low-bandwidth, high-latency network (favor image quality over performance) \
	| Pass argument of ''-wan'' to ''vncviewer'' or select \
		"Preset: Broadband (favor image quality)" from the F8 popup menu \
	| Select "Broadband (favor image quality)" Connection Profile. \
	|
#OPT: hiCol=first

The "High-Speed Network" and "Broadband (favor image quality)" connection
profiles set the JPEG compression quality to a high enough level that the
compression loss is not perceivable by the human eye.  The "Broadband (favor
performance)" connection profile sets the image quality to a very low (but
still usable) level which will achieve interactive performance on typical
broadband connections.

** Securing a TurboVNC Connection

Normally, the connection between the TurboVNC server and the TurboVNC viewer is
completely unencrypted, but securing that connection can be easily
accomplished by using the port forwarding feature of Secure Shell (SSh.)  After
you have started a TurboVNC server session on the server machine, open a new
SSh connection into the server machine using the following command line:

	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L {5900+n}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	---

	!!! If using PuTTY, replace ''ssh'' with ''putty'' in the above example.

Replace ''{user}'' with your user account name on the TurboVNC server and
''{server}'' with the hostname or IP address of that server.  Replace
''n'' with the X display number of the TurboVNC server session to which you
want to connect.

For instance, if you wish to connect to display '':1'' on server ''my_server''
using user account ''my_user'', you would type

	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 my_user@my_server
	---

After the SSh connection has been established, you can then launch the
TurboVNC viewer and point it to ''localhost:{n}'' (''localhost:1'' in the
above example.)

*** Performance Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

For LAN connections and other high-speed networks, tunneling the TurboVNC
connection over SSh will reduce performance by as much as 20% (50% if using
PuTTY.)  But for wide-area networks, broadband, etc., there is no performance
penalty for using SSh tunneling with TurboVNC.
