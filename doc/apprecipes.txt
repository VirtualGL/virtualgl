|| Application || Versions Known to Require Recipe || Platform || Recipe || Notes ||
| Abaqus | v6 | Linux \
	| It is necessary to add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''import os''{nl} \
		''os.environ['ABAQUS_EMULATE_OVERLAYS'] = "1"'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to ''/{abaqus_install_dir}/{abaqus_version}/site/abaqus_v6.env'' to make \
		Abaqus v6 work properly with VirtualGL if the 2D X server does not \
		support transparent overlays.  If this is not done, then the application \
		may fail to launch, fail to display the 3D pixels, or the 3D pixels may \
		become corrupted whenever other windows obscure them. \
	| VirtualGL does not redirect the rendering of transparent overlays, since \
		those cannot be rendered in a Pbuffer.  Thus, in order to use transparent \
		overlays, the 2D X server must be able to render them, which is rarely \
		the case for X proxies (see {ref prefix="Section ": overlays} for more \
		details.)  Setting ''ABAQUS_EMULATE_OVERLAYS'' to ''1'' causes \
		the application to emulate overlay rendering instead of using actual \
		transparent overlays.  This workaround is known to be necessary when \
		running Abaqus 6.9 and 6.10 in VNC. \
	|
| Abaqus | v6 | Linux \
	| ''vglrun -nodl {abaqus_path}/abaqus'' \
	| User reports indicate that Abaqus 6.9 will not work properly if \
		''libdlfaker.so'' from VirtualGL is preloaded into it.  This may be true \
		for other versions of Abaqus as well. \
	|
| Cadence Allegro | v16.5 | Linux \
	| ''vglrun +sync allegro''  \
	| Allegro relies on mixed X11/OpenGL rendering, and thus certain features \
		(specifically the ''pcb_cursor_infinite'' cursor style) do not work \
		properly unless ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled.  If ''VGL_SYNC'' is not enabled, \
		then the crosshairs may remain on the screen.  Since ''VGL_SYNC'' \
		automatically enables the X11 transport and disables frame spoiling, it \
		is highly recommended that you use an X proxy when ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled. \
		See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SYNC} for further information. \
	|
| Animator | v4 | Linux \
	| Comment out the line that reads \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''unsetenv LD_PRELOAD'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		in the ''a4'' script, then launch Animator 4 using \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''vglrun -ge a4'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
	| When the ''a4'' script unsets ''LD_PRELOAD'', this prevents VirtualGL \
		from being loaded into the application.  Animator 4 additionally checks \
		the value of ''LD_PRELOAD'' and attempts to unset it from inside \
		the application.  Using ''vglrun -ge'' to launch the application fools \
		Animator 4 into thinking that ''LD_PRELOAD'' is unset. \
	|
| ANSA | v12.1.0 | Linux \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''LD_PRELOAD_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD''{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD='' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of the ''ansa.sh'' script, then add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=$LD_PRELOAD_SAVE'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		just prior to the ''${ANSA_EXEC_DIR}bin/ansa_linux${ext2}'' line. \
	| The ANSA startup script directly invokes ''/lib/libc.so.6'' to query \
		the glibc version.  Since the VirtualGL faker depends on libc, preloading \
		VirtualGL when directly invoking ''libc.so.6'' creates an infinite loop. \
		Thus, it is necessary to disable the preloading of VirtualGL in the \
		application script and then re-enable it prior to launching the actual \
		application. \
	|
| ANSYS HFSS, ANSYS ICEM CFD, Roxar RMS | All | Linux \
	| Set the ''VGL_SPOILLAST'' environment variable to ''0'' prior to \
		launching the application with ''vglrun'' \
	| These applications draw node highlighting and/or rubber banding directly to the \
		front buffer.  In order for these front buffer operations to be displayed \
		properly, it is necessary to use the "spoil first" frame spoiling \
		algorithm whenever the application calls ''glFlush()''.  See \
		{ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SPOILLAST} for further information. \
	|
| AutoForm | v4.0x | All \
	| ''vglrun +sync xaf_''__''{version}''__ \
	| AutoForm relies on mixed X11/OpenGL rendering, and thus certain features \
		(particularly the "Dynamic Section" dialog and "Export Image" feature) do \
		not work properly unless ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled.  Since ''VGL_SYNC'' \
		automatically enables the X11 transport and disables frame spoiling, it \
		is highly recommended that you use an X proxy when ''VGL_SYNC'' is enabled. \
		See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SYNC} for further information. \
	|
| Cedega | v6.0.x | Linux \
	| Add \
		{nl}{nl} \
		''export LD_PRELOAD=libvglfaker.so'' \
		{nl}{nl} \
		to the top of ''~/.cedega/.winex_ver/winex-{version}/bin/winex3'', then \
		run Cedega as you would normally (without ''vglrun''.)  Since ''vglrun'' \
		is not being used, it is necessary to use environment variables or the \
		VirtualGL Configuration dialog to modify VirtualGL's configuration. \
	| The actual binary (WineX) that uses OpenGL is buried beneath several \
		layers of Python and shell scripts.  The ''LD_PRELOAD'' variable does not \
		get propagated down from the initial shell that invoked ''vglrun''. \
	|
| Google Chrome/Chromium | v31 and later | Linux \
	| ''vglrun google-chrome --disable-gpu-sandbox''{nl} \
		or{nl} \
		''vglrun chromium --disable-gpu-sandbox'' \
	| By default, Chrome/Chromium uses a separate process to perform 3D \
		rendering (WebGL), and for reasons that are not yet fully understood, \
		this breaks VirtualGL.  The ''--disable-gpu-sandbox'' option causes 3D \
		rendering to be performed within the browser process. \
	|
| Compiz | All | Linux \
	| Set the ''VGL_WM'' environment variable to ''1'' prior to launching the \
		window manager with ''vglrun'', or pass an argument of ''+wm'' to \
		''vglrun''. \
	| See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_WM} for further information. \
	|
| Heretic II | All | Linux \
	| ''vglrun heretic2 +set vid_ref glx'' \
	| {:} \
	|
| Mathematica | v7 | Linux \
	| Set the ''VGL_ALLOWINDIRECT'' environment variable to ''1'' prior to \
		launching the application with ''vglrun'' \
	| Mathematica 7 will not draw the axis numbers on 3D charts correctly \
		unless it is allowed to create an indirect OpenGL context.  See \
		{ref prefix="Section ": VGL_ALLOWINDIRECT} for further information. \
	|
| MATLAB | All | Linux \
	| ''vglrun /usr/local/MATLAB/{version}/bin/matlab -nosoftwareopengl'' \
	| MATLAB will automatically use its built-in (unaccelerated) OpenGL \
		implementation if it detects that it is running in a remote display \
		environment.  More specifically, it will always enable software OpenGL \
		if the X server has an X extension called ''VNC-EXTENSION'', which is \
		the case with TurboVNC, TigerVNC, and RealVNC. \
	|
| Tecplot 360 | 2011 and earlier | Linux \
	| Set the ''VGL_GLFLUSHTRIGGER'' environment variable to ''0'' prior to \
		launching the application with ''vglrun'' \
	| When running in TurboVNC (using VirtualGL), flashing artifacts will be \
		produced when the user zooms/pans/rotates the scene in Tecplot 360, \
		unless VirtualGL is instructed not to use ''glFlush()'' as an \
		end-of-frame trigger.  This has been fixed in Tecplot 2012 and later. \
		See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_GLFLUSHTRIGGER} for further information. \
