===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.2
===============================================================================
[1]
A 64-bit installer package can now be built on Windows platforms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.2 beta1
===============================================================================
[1]
Added VGL_SPOILLAST environment variable which, when set to 0, will change the
frame spoiling algorithm used for frames triggered by glFlush() calls.  This
is necessary to make Ansoft HFSS display properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Add compatibility mode to allow NetTest to communicate with older versions
(from VGL 2.1.x and prior.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Fix race condition in vglclient which would frequently cause an "incorrect
checksum for freed object" error when the client was shut down via CTRL-C.
This problem was reported only on OS X but could have existed on other
platforms as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1.4
===============================================================================
[1]
Added option which, when enabled, will cause VirtualGL to display a logo in the
bottom right-hand corner of the 3D window.  This is meant as a debugging tool
to allow users to determine whether or not VirtualGL is active.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Support for encrypting the VGL Transport with OpenSSL has been removed from the
default build and distribution packages.  It was only a marginally useful
feature, because VirtualGL also has the ability to tunnel the VGL Transport
through SSh.  It was necessary to maintain our own static OpenSSL libraries on
Linux in order to provide a version of VirtualGL that was compatible across all
Linux platforms, and this required us to keep abreast of the latest OpenSSL
security fixes, etc.  OpenSSL support can easily be re-added by building
VirtualGL from source (see BUILDING.txt.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Added a framework for creating generic image transport plugins.  See
rrtransport.h for a description of the API.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Removed support for the proprietary Sun Ray plugin, since that plugin is no
longer available from Sun.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
For Linux, Mac/Intel, Solaris/x86, and Windows systems, the default build of
VirtualGL no longer uses TurboJPEG/IPP (which was based on the proprietary
Intel Performance Primitives) or Sun mediaLib.  Instead, VirtualGL now uses
libjpeg-turbo, a fully open source vector-accelerated JPEG codec developed in
conjunction with the TigerVNC Project (and based on libjpeg/SIMD.)

As a result of this, it is no longer necessary to install a separate TurboJPEG
package on Linux systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Added a universal 32/64-bit VirtualGL Client binary for OS X.  The 32-bit fork
works on 10.4 "Tiger" or later, and the 64-bit fork works on 10.5 "Leopard" or
later.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Added support for encoding images as I420 YUV and displaying through X Video.
The images can either be displayed directly to the X server or sent through
the VGL transport for display using vglclient.  See the User's Guide for more
details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Renamed /etc/modprobe.d/virtualgl to /etc/modprobe.d/virtualgl.conf to comply
with the Ubuntu standard.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
Added VGL_SAMPLES environment variable (and vglrun -ms command line switch) to
force VirtualGL to select a multisampled visual or override the level of
multisampling selected by the 3D application.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
The uninstall script in the Mac distribution package should now work on OS X
10.6.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
VirtualGL can now use pixel buffer objects (PBO's) to accelerate the
readback of the 3D pixels.  This particularly helps when multiple users are
sharing the GPU.  See the "Advanced Configuration" section of the User's Guide
for more information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
On Linux systems, this version of VirtualGL works around the interaction issues
between libdlfaker.so and VirtualBox, thus eliminating the need to specify
CR_SYSTEM_GL_PATH or to run the VirtualBox application using 'vglrun -nodl'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
This version of VirtualGL provides a binary package, documentation, and full
support for Cygwin/X.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
Fixed "free(): invalid pointer" error which occurred whenever an application
called XCloseDisplay() and the VGL_XVENDOR environment variable was set.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
VirtualGL should now work properly when used with applications that render to
framebuffer objects (FBO's).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
vglconnect.bat should now work properly on 64-bit Windows systems.  Previously,
it would fail if it was installed under the "Program Files (x86)" directory.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
Added -gid option to vglserver_config to allow the group ID of the vglusers
group to be specified, if that group must be created.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18]
TCBench should now work properly on OS X.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1.3
===============================================================================
[1]
Fixed a regression bug in vglserver_config which caused a "binary operator
expected" error when restricting framebuffer device access to the vglusers
group.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Fixed an issue in vglserver_config whereby the device permissions were not
being set correctly on SuSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
VGL should now properly ignore GLX_BUFFER_SIZE if an application attempts to
specify it when requesting a true color visual.  Specifically, this allows the
Second Life SnowGlobe client to run properly in VGL and WINE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
vglserver_config should now work even if /sbin and /usr/sbin are not in the
PATH.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
The Solaris 10/x86 version of VirtualGL should now work properly with
the nVidia 18x.xx series drivers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Fix memory leak that occurred when running VirtualGL in quad-buffered stereo
mode.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
The DRI device permissions in RHEL 5 were being overridden whenever a user
logged in, because RHEL 5 uses a file in /etc/security/console.perms.d to
specify the default DRI permissions rather than using
/etc/security/console.perms.  vglserver_config has been modified to handle
this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Added support for the GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap extension so that compiz can
be run with VirtualGL.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
Added an option to vglconnect on Linux/Unix to allow it to use gsissh from the
Globus Toolkit instead of the regular ssh program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1.2
===============================================================================
[1]
VirtualGL 2.1.2 printed numerous "Cannot obtain a Pbuffer-enabled 24-bit FB
config ..." error messages when starting Google Earth.  This has been fixed,
and the message has been changed to a warning and clarified.  These error
messages were printed whenever the application called VirtualGL's interposed
version of glXChooseVisual() and that function subsequently failed to obtain an
appropriate visual for performing 3D rendering.  However, this is not
necessarily an error, because applications will sometimes call
glXChooseVisual() multiple times until they find a visual with desired
attributes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Changed the matching criteria in VirtualGL's interposed version of dlopen().
In previous versions of VirtualGL, any calls to dlopen("*libGL*") would be
replaced with a call to dlopen("librrfaker.so").  This caused problems with
VisIt, which has a library named "libGLabelPlot.so" that was being interposed
by mistake.  The matching criteria has been changed such that dlopen() only
overrides calls to dlopen("libGL\.*") or dlopen("*/libGL\.*").
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
vglserver_config should now work properly with DRI-compatible graphics drivers
(including ATI.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
VirtualGL's interposed version of dlopen() will now modify calls to
dlopen("libdl*") as well as dlopen("libGL*").  This is to work around an
interaction issue with v180.xx of the NVidia accelerated 3D drivers and WINE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
Fixed interaction issue with QT4 in which VirtualGL would not properly handle
window resize events under certain circumstances.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Moved dlopen() back into a separate faker library (libdlfaker.so.)
libdlfaker.so is loaded by default, which should maintain the behavior of
VGL 2.1.2.  However, it can be unloaded by passing an argument of '-nodl' to
vglrun.  The latter is necessary to make VirtualBox 2.2.x work with VirtualGL.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
vglserver_config should now work properly on Ubuntu 9.04 when using gdm or kdm.
It should also (mostly) work on Fedora 11 (disabling XTEST does not work on
Fedora 11 when using gdm.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Added fallback logic to VirtualGL's symbol loader which will try to directly
load the GLX/OpenGL symbols from libGL.so.1 and the X11 symbols from
libX11.so.6 if loading these symbols using dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, ...) fails.  This
is to work around an issue with version 18x.xx of the nVidia Linux Display
Driver.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
If an application window was destroyed by the window manager and the
application did not explicitly monitor and handle the WM_DELETE protocol
message, then previous versions of VirtualGL would, when using the X11 image
transport, generally abort with an X11 BadDrawable error.  This occurred
because the window was basically being ripped out from underneath VirtualGL's
blitter thread without warning.  This version of VirtualGL has been modified
to monitor WM_DELETE messages, so VirtualGL can now bow out gracefully if the
3D application window is closed by the window manager but the application
does not handle WM_DELETE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Worked around an interaction issue with IDL whereby the application was calling
XGetGeometry() with the same pointer for every argument, and this was causing
VirtualGL to lose the width and height data returned from the "real"
XGetGeometry() function.  Subsequently, the Pbuffer corresponding to the main
IDL window would become improperly sized, and the rendering area would not
appear to update.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
Added VGL_TRAPX11 option, which will cause VirtualGL to gracefully trap X11
errors, print a warning message when these occur, and allow the application to
continue running.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1.1
===============================================================================
[1]
Fixed a buffer overrun issue in TurboJPEG/mediaLib that may have caused
problems on Solaris/x86 VirtualGL servers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Integrated libdlfaker.so into librrfaker.so to eliminate the need for
invoking 'vglrun -dl'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Developed a proper uninstaller app for the Mac OS X VirtualGL package.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Modified MAXINST variable in SUNWvgl Solaris package to prevent multiple
instances of this package from being installed simultaneously.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1
===============================================================================
[1]
Fixed issues that occurred when displaying to the second or subsequent
screens on a multi-screen X server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Updated to wxWindows Library License v3.1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Added uncompressed YUV encoding option to the Sun Ray plugin.  This provides
significantly better performance than DPCM on Sun Ray 1 clients, and it
provides significantly better image quality in all cases.  YUV encoding will
generally use about 50% more network bandwidth than DPCM, all else being equal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Further optimized the Huffman encoder in the mediaLib implementation of
TurboJPEG.  This should decrease the CPU usage when running VirtualGL on
Solaris VirtualGL servers, particularly Solaris/x86 servers running 32-bit
applications.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
vglconnect now works properly with Cygwin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Fixed regression that caused VirtualGL to remove any part of the VGL_XVENDOR
string following the first white space.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
vglserver_config now works properly with OpenSolaris systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
glXUseXFont() now works if a Pixmap is the current drawable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
vglserver_config now works properly with Debian Linux systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Fixed a typo in vglconnect which caused it to leave temporary files lying
about.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
Removed libXm (Motif) dependency in the Solaris/x86 version of VirtualGL.  This
mainly affects OpenSolaris systems, on which Motif is not available.  The
libXm dependency was introduced in VirtualGL 2.0.x because that version of
VirtualGL used libXt (X Intrinsics) to generate its popup configuration dialog.
Java requires that libXm be loaded ahead of libXt, so it was necessary to
explicitly link the VirtualGL faker library with libXm to guarantee that the
libraries were loaded in the correct order.  Since VirtualGL 2.1.x and later no
longer use libXt, the binding to libXm could be safely removed on x86 systems.
Note, however, that the libXm binding still has to be included on SPARC
systems, because libGL on SPARC depends on libXmu, which depends on libXt.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
Fixed an issue with GeomView whereby attempting to resize the oldest window in
a multi-window view would cause the Exceed version of vglclient to crash.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
When used to configure a Solaris server for GLX mode with open access (all
users being able to access the local X server, not just members of the vglusers
group), vglserver_config was incorrectly placing xhost entries at the top of
/etc/dt/config/Xsetup instead of the bottom.  This could have led to problems,
since xhost is not guaranteed to be in the PATH until the bottom of that
script.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
VirtualGL should now build and run cleanly on Ubuntu systems (and possibly
other Debian derivatives, although only Ubuntu has been tested.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
Certain applications call glFlush() thousands of times in rapid succession
when rendering to the front buffer, even if no part of the 3D scene has
changed.  Sparing the gorey details, this caused the VirtualGL pipeline to
become overloaded in certain cases, particularly on systems with fast pixel
readback.  On such systems, every one of the glFlush() commands resulted in
VirtualGL drawing or sending a frame, even if the pixels in the frame were
identical to those in the previous frame.  This resulted in application delays
of up to several minutes.  This version of VGL includes a mechanism which
ensures that no more than 100 glFlush() commands per second will actually
result in an image being drawn or sent, and thus strings of rapid fire
glFlush() commands can no longer overload the pipeline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
vglserver_config should now work with openSUSE systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
It was discovered that 'xhost +LOCAL:' is a better method of enabling 3D X
server access to all users of the VirtualGL server.  This method works even
if TCP connections are disabled in the X server (which is the case on recent
Solaris and Linux distributions.)  vglserver_config has thus been modified to
use this method rather than 'xhost +localhost'.  Also, since it is no longer
necessary to set DisallowTCP=false in the GDM configuration file,
vglserver_config now comments out this line if it exists.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18]
Fixed deadlock that occurred when using the VirtualGL Sun Ray plugin and
ParaView to render multi-context datasets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19]
Fixed an issue with Mac X11 2.1.x on OS X 10.5 "Leopard" whereby vglconnect
would abort with "Could not open log file."  X11 2.1.x uses a DISPLAY
environment of the form /tmp/launch-*/:0, so it was necessary to remove
everything up to the last slash before using this variable to build a unique
vglclient log file path.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20]
Include libgefaker.so in the Solaris VirtualGL packages (oops).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[21]
Added an interposed version of XSolarisGetVisualGamma() on SPARC servers so
that applications that require gamma-corrected visuals can be fooled into
thinking a gamma-corrected visual is available when in fact VirtualGL's
software gamma correction mechanism is being used instead.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[22]
Fixed a bug in the color conversion routines of TurboJPEG/mediaLib which
caused the Solaris VirtualGL Client to display incorrect pixels along the
right-most edge of the window when 2X or 4X subsampling was used.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes since 2.1 beta1
===============================================================================
[1]
Windows applications now link statically with OpenSSL to avoid dependency on
msvcr71.dll that was introduced in the Win32 OpenSSL 0.9.8e DLLs.  libeay32.dll
and ssleay32.dll have been removed from the Windows package, since they are
no longer needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Implemented a new interposer library (libgefaker.so) which, when active, will
interpose on getenv() and return NULL whenever an application queries the
value of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable (and, on Solaris, the
LD_PRELOAD_32 and LD_PRELOAD_64 environment variables.)  This fools an
application into thinking that no preloading is occurring.  This feature is
currently undocumented and is subject to change, but it can be activated in
this release by passing an argument of -ge to vglrun.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Extended VGL_SYNC functionality to include glXSwapBuffers() as well.  This
works around a couple of interaction issues between VirtualGL and AutoForm.
The docs have been updated to explain this new functionality, to include an app
recipe for AutoForm, and to include a warning about the performance
consequences of using VGL_SYNC on a remote X connection.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Included a short paragraph in the Chromium section of the docs explaining how
to use VirtualGL on the render nodes to redirect Chromium's rendering from a
window to a Pbuffer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
Documented the patch revision necessary to make Exceed 2008 work properly with
VirtualGL.  Removed dire warnings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Added full-screen rendering mode to GLXspheres.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Fixed regression (uninitialized variable) introduced by [2.1 beta1][7].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Fixed logic error that caused vglclient to fail when using OpenGL drawing and
talking to a legacy (VGL 2.0 or earlier) server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
Fixed regression bug that would cause VGL to deadlock when the user closed
the application window while using the X11 Image Transport.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Fixed issue whereby vglserver_config would fail to detect the presence of GLP
because nm was not in the default PATH.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
When running VirtualGL on Enterprise Linux 5 using the 100 series NVidia
drivers, a normal exit from the application will result in
glXChannelRectSyncSGIX() being called after the VirtualGL hashes have already
been destructed.  glXChannelRectSyncSGIX() calls XFree() (an interposed
function), and under certain circumstances, the interposed version of XFree()
was trying (and failing) to access one of the previously destructed VirtualGL
hashes.  This has been fixed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
vglclient -kill now works properly on Solaris systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
Fixed a timing snafu in and raised the run priority of Windows version of
TCBench.  This improves the accuracy of TCBench on Windows in high client CPU
usage scenarios.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
Fixed an issue in the interactive mode of GLXSpheres whereby it would use 100%
of the CPU when sitting idle.  Added option to GLXSpheres to adjust the
polygon count of the scene.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
Added app recipes for ANSYS and Cedega to docs.  Added notes describing
ANSYS and Pro/E duplicate glFlush() issue and workarounds.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
Changed default value for VGL_NPROCS to 1 (performance study indicates that
there is no longer any measurable advantage to multi-threaded compression on
modern hardware with VGL 2.1.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
Added a -bench option to nettest to allow it to measure actual usage on a
given Solaris or Linux network device.  This was necessitated by accuracy
issues with other open source network monitoring solutions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18]
Change the way global hash tables are allocated in VGL in order to fix an
interaction issue with applications that are built with MainWin.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19]
vglclient -kill now works properly on Mac systems.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20]
VirtualGL Configuration dialog now pops up properly when Caps Lock is active.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[21]
If a previously destroyed GLX context is passed as an argument to
glXMake{Context}Current(), the function now returns False instead of throwing
a fatal exception.  This was necessary to make a couple of different commercial
applications work properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[22]
There was some inconsistency regarding the interface for enabling lossless
compression in the Sun Ray Image Transport.  The User's Guide listed the
interface as VGL_COMPRESS=srrgb, whereas the output of vglrun listed the
interface as -c srlossless.  VirtualGL 2.1rc only responded to the latter
interface.  It now responds to both interfaces, but VGL_COMPRESS=srrgb is the
correct and documented interface.  Any errant references to "srlossless" have
been changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
New Features Introduced in 2.1 beta1
===============================================================================
[1]
The VirtualGL Configuration Dialog is now written with FLTK instead of X
Intrinsics.  The dialog is also now handled by a separate process (vglconfig)
to avoid application interaction issues.  VirtualGL and vglconfig communicate
changes to the configuration through shared memory.

Note that this renders both the VGL_GUI_XTTHREADINIT configuration option and
the corresponding application recipe for VisConcept unnecessary, and thus both
have been removed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
A new set of scripts (vglconnect and vgllogin) which automate the process of
connecting to a VirtualGL server and using the VGL Image Transport (formerly
"Direct Mode.")  vglconnect wraps both vglclient and ssh.  Through the use
of command line arguments, vglconnect can be configured to forward either the
X11 traffic or the VGL image traffic (or none or both) over the SSh connection.
vglconnect invokes vgllogin on the server, which configures the server
environment with the proper VGL_CLIENT and VGL_PORT values so that, once
connected, all you should have to do is simply launch your application with
vglrun.  See the documentation for more information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
vglclient includes many changes to support vglconnect.  Rather than listen
just on ports 4242 and 4243, the default behavior of vglclient is now to find a
free listening port in the range of 4200-4299 (it tries 4242 and 4243 first,
to maintain backward compatibility.)  vglclient records its listening port in
an X property that is later read by the VGL server.  This feature allows more
than one instance of vglclient to run on the same machine. The client can also
detach completely from the console and run as a background daemon, exiting only
when the X server resets or when vglclient is explicitly killed.

Previous versions of VirtualGL required one instance of vglclient to talk to
all X displays on the client machine, but this created problems in multi-
user environments.  Thus, VirtualGL 2.1 runs a separate instance of vglclient
for each unique X display.  This eliminates the need (as well as the ability)
to run vglclient as a root daemon or as an NT service, and thus those features
have been removed.

Since vglclient is intended to be launched from vglconnect, Start Menu links to
the VirtualGL Client are no longer included in the Windows package.

See the documentation for more information about the changes to vglclient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
The Windows VirtualGL package now includes an optimized version of PuTTY 0.60
which is used by the Windows version of vglconnect.  This version of PuTTY
provides significantly better performance when tunneling the VGL image stream
than the stock version of PuTTY 0.60.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
A new script (vglserver_config) which automates the process of configuring
the X display on the VirtualGL server to allow connections from VirtualGL.
This script can also be used to configure GLP, for machines that support it.
See the documentation for more information.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
The VirtualGL Unix packages now include a benchmark called "GLXSpheres", which
is an open source look-alike of the old NVidia SphereMark demo.  This program
is meant to provide an alternative to GLXGears, since the images generated by
the latter program contain too much solid color to be a good test of
VirtualGL's image pipeline.  GLXSpheres also includes modes which can be used
to test VirtualGL's support of advanced OpenGL features, such as stereo,
overlays, and color index rendering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
VirtualGL now works properly with multi-process OpenGL applications that use
one process to handle X events and another process to handle 3D rendering.
In particular, this eliminates the window resize issues with Abaqus/CAE and
with the Chromium readback SPU.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Added an additional subsampling option to enable grayscale JPEG encoding.
This provides additional bandwidth savings over and above chrominance
subsampling, since grayscale throws away all chrominance pixels.  It is
potentially useful when working with applications that already render grayscale
images (medical imaging, etc.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
VirtualGL can now encode images as uncompressed RGB and send these uncompressed
images through the VGL Image Transport.  This has two benefits:  (1) it
eliminates the need to use the X11 Image Transport (AKA "Raw Mode") over a
network, and (2) it provides a mode which supports sending lossless stereo
image pairs to a stereo-enabled client.  A gigabit or faster network is
recommended when using RGB encoding.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Anaglyphic stereo support.  When VirtualGL detects that an application has
rendered something in stereo, its default behavior is to try using quad-
buffered stereo.  But if the client or the image transport do not support
quad-buffered stereo, then VirtualGL will fall back to using anaglyphic
(red/cyan) stereo.  This provides a quick & dirty way to visualize stereo data
on clients that do not support "real" stereo rendering.

VirtualGL 2.1 can also be configured to send only the left eye or right eye
image from a stereo application.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
Changed the way VirtualGL spoils frames.  In previous versions, VirtualGL would
throw out any new frames if the queue was already busy compressing or
sending a previous frame.  In 2.1, VirtualGL instead throws out any undisplayed
frames in the queue and promotes every new frame to the head of the queue.
This assures that the last frame in a rendering sequence will always be
displayed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
Better integration with the Sun Ray plugin.  In particular, many of the Sun Ray
plugin's configuration options can now be configured through the VirtualGL
Configuration dialog.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
The Mac client is now fully documented.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
Included mediaLib Huffman encoding optimizations contributed by Sun.  This
boosts the performance of VirtualGL on Solaris systems by as much as 30%.
This, in combination with mediaLib 2.5, should allow the Solaris/x86 version
of VirtualGL to perform the same as the Linux version, all else being equal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
Lighting did not work properly for color index applications in prior versions
of VGL.  This has been fixed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
Fixed an interaction issue with the 100 series NVidia drivers whereby
applications that would request a single-buffered RGB visual would sometimes
fail to obtain it through VirtualGL.  The newer NVidia drivers don't always
return an RGB 8/8/8 framebuffer config as the first in the list, so it was
necessary for VirtualGL to specify GLX_RED_SIZE/GLX_GREEN_SIZE/GLX_BLUE_SIZE
when obtaining a framebuffer config on the VirtualGL server's X display.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
Interframe comparison now works properly with stereo image pairs, and
interframe comparison can now be disabled by using the VGL_INTERFRAME option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes between 2.0 final and 2.0.1
===============================================================================
[1]
The Linux and Solaris versions of VirtualGL are now statically linked with
OpenSSL.  This fixes an issue whereby a 3D application that uses OpenSSL could
override VirtualGL's SSL bindings, thus causing VirtualGL to crash if SSL was
enabled (VGL_SSL=1 or vglrun +s) and if the application's version of OpenSSL
was incompatible with VirtualGL's.

This, combined with [5] below, has the added benefit of allowing a single
VirtualGL RPM to be used across multiple Linux platforms.  It is no longer
necessary to use a separate RPM for different versions of Enterprise Linux,
SuSE, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
librrfaker.so and libturbojpeg.so are now being linked with map files (AKA
"anonymous version scripts" on Linux.)  This is mainly a preventative measure,
because it hides any non-global symbols in the shared objects, thus preventing
those symbols from accidentally interposing on a symbol in an application or
in another shared object.  However, [2] was also necessary to prevent [1] from
causing the opposite problem from the one it was intended to fix (without [2],
VirtualGL could interpose on an application's SSL bindings rather than vice
versa.)

Linux users will need to upgrade to TurboJPEG 1.04.2 (or later) to get this
fix.  For other platforms, the fix is included in the VGL 2.0.1 packages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
librr.so, rr.h, and the rrglxgears.c sample application have been removed from
the distribution packages.  These demonstrated a strawman API for creating a
VGL movie player.  The API was somewhat ill-conceived and broken, and it needs
to be revisited.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
VirtualGL's custom version of glxinfo is now included in the distribution
packages, under /opt/{SUNWvgl|VirtualGL}/bin.  This version of glxinfo supports
GLP on Sparc servers and also has the ability to query GLX FB Configs as well
as X visuals.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
VGL now uses direct linking to link against libCrun on Solaris and static
linking to link against libstdc++ on Linux.  This is to prevent a problem
similar to [1] in which an application that overrides the default C++ new and
delete operators could force VGL to use its custom new and delete operators
rather than the default operators provided in libCrun/libstdc++.  Specifically,
this addresses an issue whereby Pro/E would spuriously crash on multi-processor
Solaris/Sparc machines.

libstdc++ is statically linked on Linux because Linux has no equivalent of
Direct linking, but static linking against libstdc++ has the added benefit of
allowing one VirtualGL RPM to be used across multiple Linux platforms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Eliminated the use of the X DOUBLE-BUFFER extension in Raw Mode and replaced it
instead with X Pixmap drawing.  Previously, VGL would try to use the MIT-SHM
extension to draw images in Raw Mode, then it would fall back to using the X
DOUBLE-BUFFER extension if MIT-SHM was not available or could not be used (such
as on a remote X connection), then it would fall back to single buffered
drawing if DOUBLE-BUFFER could not be used.  However, the DOUBLE-BUFFER
extension crashes on some Sun Ray configurations (specifically Xinerama
configurations), so VGL 2.0 disabled the use of DOUBLE-BUFFER on all Sun Ray
configurations to work around this issue.  [6] replaces that hack with a more
solid fix that ensures that Raw Mode is always double buffered, even if the X
DOUBLE-BUFFER extension is not available or is not working.  Using pixmap
drawing performs the same as using DOUBLE-BUFFER.

This generally only affects cases in which Raw Mode is used to transmit images
over a network.  When Raw Mode is used to transmit images to an X server on the
same machine, it is almost always able to use the MIT-SHM X extension.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Numerous doc changes, including:
  -- Restructuring docs to create a more clear delineation between what needs
     to be done on the server and what needs to be done on the client.
  -- (Re-)added instructions for how to use VGL with a direct X11 connection,
     since it has become apparent that that configuration is necessary in
     some cases.
  -- Changed procedure for doing Direct Mode SSh tunneling.  The previous
     procedure would not have worked if multiple users were trying to tunnel
     Direct Mode from the same server.  The new procedure requires running a
     program (see [8] below) which prints out an available TCP port and using
     that port on the server end of the SSh tunnel.
  -- Added app recipe for ANSA 12.1.0
  -- Added procedures for using VGL with TurboVNC and for using TurboVNC in
     general
  -- Added information for using VGL with GLP (which, unbelievably, was never
     really included in the VGL docs.  Major oversight on our part.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Modified the 'nettest' program such that it finds a free TCP port number and
prints out the port number to the console when you pass an argument of
'-findport' to the program.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
Fixed glXGetProcAddressARB() and glXGetProcAddress() on Sparc platforms.  Due
to an erroneous #ifdef statement, these interposed functions were not getting
compiled into VirtualGL when VirtualGL was built with Sun OpenGL on Sparc
platforms.

This, combined with [16], allows Java2D apps running in VirtualGL on Sparc
platforms to successfully use the OpenGL pipeline to perform Java2D rendering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Sun OpenGL 120812-15 (and later) now includes a SwapBuffers() command for GLP,
which VirtualGL will now use if available.  Some applications that use front
buffer drawing (Pro/E and UGS/NX v4, specifically) did not work properly with
VirtualGL 2.0 in GLP mode because the back buffer in the double-buffered
Pbuffer was not being swapped.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
Some applications call XListExtensions() rather than XQueryExtension() to probe
for the existence of the GLX extension.  Such applications, when displaying to
VNC or another X server that lacks the GLX extension, would fail.  VirtualGL
now interposes on XListExtensions() and makes sure that the GLX extension is
always reported as present.  This fixes a specific issue with UGS/NX v4 whereby
NX, if run with VirtualGL and TurboVNC, would refuse to use OpenGL to perform
its 3D rendering.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
VGL will now print a warning if the GLX context it obtains on the server's
display is indirect.  This will occur on Solaris if the framebuffer device
permissions do not allow read/write access for the current user.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
Normally, if X11 drawing is the default in the VGL client (which is the case
on non-Sparc systems, on Sparc systems with 2D framebuffers, or on any system
if 'vglclient' is invoked with the '-x' argument), then the VGL client will
only use OpenGL for drawing stereo frames.  [13] fixes a bug whereby the VGL
client would not switch back to X11 drawing (if X11 drawing was the default)
after the app ceased rendering in stereo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
You can now specify a listen port number of 0 to make the VGL client pick an
available port.  This is of only marginal use at the moment, since there is
no way to make the server automatically connect to that port.  But we got this
for free as a result of [8].
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
Fixed an issue that was causing the multi-threaded tests in rrfakerut to crash
some of the NVidia 7xxx series drivers.  rrfakerut should now run cleanly on
the 7xxx series, but the multi-threaded tests still cause the 8xxx series
drivers to crash & burn, and they cause the 9xxx series drivers to generate
incorrect pixels.  Further investigation is needed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
Fixed two issues to make Java2D on Solaris/Sparc properly detect that OpenGL is
available:
  -- Made glXChooseFBConfig() ignore the GLX_VISUAL_ID attribute.  That
     attribute doesn't really have any meaning in VGL, and passing it through
     to the server's X display was causing Java2D apps to fail.
  -- Made glXGetFBConfigAttrib(GLX_DRAWABLE_TYPE) always return
     GLX_PIXMAP_BIT|GLX_PBUFFER_BIT|GLX_WINDOW_BIT so that Java2D apps would
     properly detect that window rendering was available in VirtualGL.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
vglrun will now print usage information if you fail to provide an application
command to run.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18]
Upgraded the OpenSSL DLL included with the Windows VirtualGL client to OpenSSL
0.9.8d (previously 0.9.8c.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19]
VirtualGL now buffers the output from the profiler class so that the profiling
output from multiple compression threads doesn't intermingle when redirected to
a log file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20]
If the DISPLAY environment variable is unset on the VirtualGL server, vglrun
will now set it automatically to {ssh_client}:0.0 (where {ssh_client} = the IP
address of the SSh client.)  If DISPLAY is set to localhost:n.0 or
`hostname`:n.0, VGL assumes that SSh X11 forwarding is in use and sets
VGL_CLIENT={ssh_client}:0.0 instead (without modifying DISPLAY.)  vglrun prints
a warning that it is doing this.  You must still explicitly set VGL_CLIENT or
DISPLAY if you are doing something exotic, such as tunneling VGL's
client/server connection through SSh or displaying to an X server with a
display number other than 0.  But this fix should eliminate the need to set
VGL_CLIENT and DISPLAY in most cases.  Note that the Sun Ray plugin also reads
the VGL_CLIENT environment variable, so if you are connecting to the VirtualGL
server from a Sun Ray server using SSh X11 forwarding, this eliminates the need
to explicitly set VGL_CLIENT in that case as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[21]
Implement the "spoil last frame" algorithm in the Sun Ray plugin whenever VGL
reads back/compresses/sends the framebuffer in response to a glFlush().  This
fixes issues with slow model regeneration and zoom operations in Pro/E when
using the Sun Ray plugin.

Normally, the Sun Ray plugin uses the "spoil first frame" algorithm, which
causes the frames in the queue to be discarded whenever a new frame is
received.  But this algorithm requires that the framebuffer be read back for
every frame, even if that frame is ultimately going to be spoiled.  This
causes problems with applications (Pro/E, specifically) that call glFlush()
frequently when doing front buffer drawing.  Each of these glFlush() calls
triggers a framebuffer readback in VirtualGL, which can cause significant
interaction delays in the application.  The "spoil last frame" algorithm
discards the newest frame if the queue is currently busy, so when this
algorithm is used, most of the duplicate frames triggered by the repeated
glFlush() events are discarded with no framebuffer readback (and thus very
little overhead.)

This fix does not affect Direct Mode and Raw Mode, since those modes already
use the "spoil last frame" algorithm in all cases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[22]
Added VGL_INTERFRAME option, which, when set to 0, will disable interframe
image comparison in Direct Mode.  This is necessary to work around an
interaction issue between VGL and Pro/E Wildfire v3 which leads to slow
performance when zooming in or out on the Pro/E model.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[23]
Added VGL_LOG option, which can be used to redirect the console output from the
VGL faker to a file instead of stderr.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[24]
The mediaLib implementation of TurboJPEG and the mediaLib-accelerated gamma
correction code have been modified slightly to avoid calls to mediaLib
functions that wrap memalign() and free().  This works around an interaction
issue with Pro/E v3 (and potentially with other applications that use their
own custom memory allocators.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes between 2.0beta3 and 2.0 final:
===============================================================================
[1]
Included libturbojpeg.dylib in Mac package (so that installing the TurboJPEG
package is no longer necessary unless you want to rebuild VGL from source.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Included TCBench and NetTest in the Mac package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Internal gamma correction system added.  This was a last-minute feature
addition to address the issue that there was no way to gamma correct
applications that were remotely displayed to non-Sparc clients.  Sparc users
are accustomed to OpenGL applications being gamma corrected by default, so
VirtualGL now mimics this behavior whenever it is running on a Sparc server,
even if the client machine is not a Sparc machine.

The behavior of the VGL_GAMMA environment variable has changed as follows:

VGL_GAMMA=1 (or vglrun +g):
  Enable gamma correction using the best available method.  If displaying to a
  Sparc X server which has gamma corrected visuals, try to use those gamma-
  corrected visuals.  Otherwise, enable VGL's internal gamma correction system
  with a gamma correction factor of 2.22.

  This is the default when running applications on Sparc VirtualGL servers.

VGL_GAMMA=0 (or vglrun -g):
  Do not use gamma-corrected visuals (even if available on the X server) and do
  not use VGL's internal gamma correction system.

  This is the default when running applications on non-Sparc VirtualGL servers.

VGL_GAMMA={f} (or vglrun -gamma {f}):
  Do not use gamma-corrected visuals (even if available on the client), but
  enable VGL's internal gamma correction system with a gamma correction factor
  of {f}.

The internal gamma correction system uses a few percent more CPU cycles than
just compressing the images alone, but this has not been shown to affect the
overall performance of VGL by a measurable amount.

See the "VGL_GAMMA" entry in Chapter 18 of the docs for more info.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Increased the size of the TurboJPEG compression holding buffer to account for
rare cases in which compressing very high-frequency image tiles (specifically
parts of the 3D Studio MAX Viewperf test) with high quality levels
(specifically Q99 or above) would produce JPEG images that are larger than the
uncompressed input.

Linux users will need to upgrade to TurboJPEG 1.04 (or later) to get this fix.
For other platforms, the fix is included in the VGL 2.0 packages.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
Minor documentation changes, including a change to the recommended OpenGL
patches for Sparc VGL servers and an application recipe for SDRC I-deas Master
Series.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Check for exceptions in the new operator to prevent VGL from dying ungracefully
in out-of-memory situations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Fixed a bug in the multi-threaded compression code whereby it would use too
much memory to hold the image tiles for the second and subsequent compression
threads.  This led to memory exhaustion if the tile size was set to a low value
(such as 16x16 or 32x32.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes between 2.0beta2 and 2.0beta3:
===============================================================================
[1]
Solaris packages now include the OpenSSL shared libraries (libssl and
libcrypto), thus eliminating the need to install Blastwave OpenSSL on Solaris 9
and prior.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Packages now include a convenience script (vglgenkey) which will generate an
xauth key for the server's X display.  This provides a more secure way of
granting access to the server's X display than using 'xhost +localhost'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Built and packaged the VirtualGL client for Mac OS/X (Intel only.)  This
package is currently undocumented and includes only the VGL client (no server
components), but its usage should be self explanatory for those familiar with
VGL on other platforms (it should work very similarly to the Linux version.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Normally, when running in Raw Mode, VirtualGL will try to use the MIT-SHM X
extension to draw images.  If MIT-SHM is not available or doesn't work (which
would be the case if the X connection is remote), then VGL will try to use
the X DOUBLE-BUFFER extension.  Failing that, it will fall back to single
buffered drawing.  In a Sun Ray environment, the X DOUBLE-BUFFER extension
is unstable when Xinerama is used.  DOUBLE-BUFFER doesn't really double buffer
in a Sun Ray environment anyhow, so this release of VirtualGL disables the use
of DOUBLE-BUFFER if it detects that it is running in a Sun Ray environment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
Reformatted documentation using Deplate (http://deplate.sourceforge.net.)
Numerous other doc changes as well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Extended VGL to support the full GLX 1.4 spec (this involved simply creating
a function stub for glXGetProcAddress(), but it was necessary to make J2D work
under Java 6.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Changed key sequence for the popup configuration dialog (again) to
CTRL-SHIFT-F9 to avoid a conflict with Solaris Common Desktop Environment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
VGL no longer tries to switch to Direct Mode automatically whenever a stereo
frame is rendered.  Instead, if running in Raw Mode, it warns that stereo
doesn't work in Raw Mode and proceeds to send only the left eye buffer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
Significant changes between 2.0beta1 and 2.0beta2:
===============================================================================
[1]
Added a -dl option to vglrun, which inserts a new libdlfaker.so interposer
ahead of VirtualGL in the link order.  libdlfaker.so intercepts dlopen() calls
from an application and, if the application is trying to dlopen() libGL,
librrfaker.so (VirtualGL) is dlopen()ed instead.  This allows VirtualGL to be
used seamlessly with applications that do not dynamically link against libGL
and do not provide any sort of override mechanism.  See the documentation for a
list of known applications that require the -dl option.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2]
Bug fixed:  Lazy loading of OpenSSL on Solaris now works properly, so that
OpenSSL doesn't have to be installed unless VirtualGL is being used in SSL
mode.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[3]
Added "application recipes" section to docs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[4]
Tweaked FBX library to improve performance of VGL when used with NX and FreeNX.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[5]
Bug fixed:  TurboJPEG for Solaris did not properly handle 4:2:0 decompression
if no pixel format conversion was required.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[6]
Bug fixed:  Minor (and somewhat esoteric) visual matching bug in GLP mode
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[7]
Bug fixed:  In GLX mode, VGL did not properly handle FB configs that had no
associated X Visual type.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[8]
Stereo now works on Solaris/Sparc servers using kfb framebuffers in both GLP
and GLX modes.  Sun OpenGL patch 120812-12 (or later) and KFB driver patch
120928-10 (or later) are required.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[9]
Bug fixed:  In GLX mode, some of the "real" GLX functions that VirtualGL calls
on the server's X display will in turn call glXGetClientString(),
glXQueryExtensions(), etc. to list extensions available on the server's
X display.  VirtualGL interposes on these functions and returns its own
extension strings rather than the "real" strings from the server's X display,
and this caused problems under certain circumstances.  These interposed
functions will now detect whether they are being called from within another
GLX function and will return the "real" extension strings for the server's X
display if so.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[10]
Generally friendlier error messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[11]
Bug fixed:  Destroying an overlay window would cause VGL to seg fault.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[12]
Changed configuration dialog popup key sequence to CTRL-SHIFT-F12 to avoid
conflict with KDE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[13]
Added VGL_GUI_XTHREADINIT environment variable to allow one to disable VGL's
use of XtToolkitThreadInitialize().  Rarely, a multi-threaded Motif application
relies on its own locking mechanisms and will deadlock if Motif's built-in
application and process locks are enabled.  Thus far, the only known
application that this affects is VisConcept.  Set VGL_GUI_XTHREADINIT to 0 to
prevent VisConcept from deadlocking when the VGL config dialog is activated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[14]
VirtualGL will no longer allow a non-TrueColor stereo visual to be selected,
because such visuals won't work with the VGL client.  Color index (PseudoColor)
rendering requires Raw Mode, but stereo requires Direct Mode, and thus
VirtualGL cannot transmit PseudoColor images in stereo.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[15]
VirtualGL will now automatically select Raw Mode if it detects that it is
running on a "local" display (i.e. ":n.0", "unix:n.0", etc., but not
"localhost:n.0")  This allows users of X proxies such as Sun Ray, TurboVNC,
NX, etc. to run VirtualGL without having to pass an argument of -c 0 to vglrun.
"localhost:n.0" is not considered a "local" display, and neither is
"`hostname`:n.0", because display connections tunneled through SSh will have a
display name that takes on one of those forms.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[16]
The VirtualGL client for Solaris/Sparc will now automatically detect if it
is running on a framebuffer that uses software OpenGL and will default to using
X11 drawing in that case.  Otherwise, if hardware-accelerated OpenGL is
available, then the VGL client for Solaris/Sparc will try to use OpenGL as the
default drawing method.  This improves performance on XVR-100 and its ilk as
well as working around a bug in the OGL implementation on XVR-100 (see CR
6408535.)  Non-Sparc clients still use X11 drawing by default, except when
drawing stereo frames.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[17]
Worked around some issues in Sun OpenGL which manifested themselves in
instability of the Sparc VirtualGL client when drawing large numbers of
simultaneous frames from different servers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[18]
Expanded N1 GridEngine hooks in vglrun so that the VGL_CLIENT, VGL_COMPRESS,
VGL_PORT, VGL_SSL, VGL_GLLIB, and VGL_X11LIB environment variables will be
automatically passed to vglrun by N1GE.  All other variables must be explicitly
passed by using the -v option to qsub.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[19]
Bug fixed:  Lazy loading of OpenGL now works properly on Solaris clients, so
vglclient can be run on machines that don't have OpenGL installed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[20]
For some reason, popping up the VGL configuration dialog when running Java
apps caused VGL's Xt resource string to be ignored, which would cause the
widgets to be displayed incorrectly.  So VirtualGL now explicitly specifies the
resources when creating each widget and doesn't rely on the use of a resource
string.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
