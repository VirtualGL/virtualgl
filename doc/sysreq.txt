		{list type=ul: \
			{item:For optimal performance, particularly with multiple simultaneous \
				users, a professional-grade GPU such as the AMD Radeon Pro or nVidia \
				Quadro is recommended.} \
			{item:Install the AMD or nVidia proprietary drivers.  Open source \
				drivers for these GPUs do not always provide full 3D acceleration, \
				and some of those drivers are not fully compatible with VirtualGL.}} \

	| VirtualGL should work with a variety of Linux distributions, \
		[[http://www.freebsd.org][FreeBSD]], and \
		[[http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/solaris][Solaris]], \
		but currently-supported versions of \
		[[http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/][Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] \
		and its derivatives, [[http://www.ubuntu.com][Ubuntu]] LTS, and \
		[[http://www.suse.com][SuSE]] Linux Enterprise tend to receive the most \
		attention from the VirtualGL community. \

** Additional Requirements for Stereographic Rendering
{anchor: Stereo_Requirements}

	!!! The client requirements do not apply to anaglyphic stereo.  See
	{ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_OpenGL} for more details.

| Linux/Unix \
	| {list type=ul: \

				nVidia Quadro)} \

			{item:GPU that supports stereo} \
			{item:The 2D X server should be configured to export stereo visuals.}} \

** Additional Requirements for Transparent Overlays
{anchor: Overlay_Requirements}

|| || Client ||
| Linux/Unix \
	| GPU that supports transparent overlays.  The 2D X server should be \
			configured to export overlay visuals. \
	|
| Mac/x86 \
	| ^ \
	|
| Windows \
	| This version of VirtualGL does not support transparent overlays with \
		Windows clients. \
