* Configuring a Linux or Solaris Machine as a VirtualGL Server

** GLP: Using VirtualGL Without an X Server
{anchor: GLP_Usage}

Sun's OpenGL library for Solaris/Sparc systems has a special extension called
"GLP" which allows VirtualGL to directly access a 3D graphics card even if
there is no X server running on the card.  GLP greatly improves the
overall security of the VirtualGL server, since it eliminates the need to grant
X server access to VirtualGL users.  In addition, GLP makes it easy to assign
VirtualGL jobs to any graphics card in a multi-card system.

If your system is running [[http://www.sun.com/software/graphics/opengl/][Sun OpenGL]]
1.5 for Solaris/Sparc, it is recommended that you configure it to use GLP:

	#. Log in as root.

	#. Run

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglserver_config
		---

	#. Select option 3 (''Configure server for use with VirtualGL in GLP mode''.)

	#. {:}

		#Verb: <<---
		Restrict framebuffer device access to vglusers group (recommended)?
		[Y/n]
		---

		Yes :: Only users in the ''vglusers'' group can run OpenGL applications on
			the VirtualGL server (the configuration script will create the
			''vglusers'' group if it doesn't already exist.)  This limits the
			possibility that an unauthorized user could snoop the 3D framebuffer
			device(s) and thus see (or alter) the 3D output of an application running
			in VirtualGL.

		No :: Any authenticated user can run OpenGL applications on the VirtualGL
			server.  If it is necessary for users outside of the ''vglusers'' group
			to log in locally to the server and run OpenGL applications, then this
			is probably the best option.

	#. If you chose to restrict framebuffer device access to the
		''vglusers'' group, then edit ''/etc/group'' and add ''root'' to the
		''vglusers'' group.  If you choose, you can also add additional users to
		the group at this time.

	#. Edit the ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' file as necessary.  This file
		contains a list of paths to 3D framebuffer devices (such as
		''/dev/fbs/kfb0'', ''/dev/fbs/jfb0'', etc.) that you wish to use with
		VirtualGL.

*** Sanity Check
#OPT: noList! plain!

To verify that the system is ready to run VirtualGL, log out of the server,
log back into the server using SSh, and execute the following command in the
SSh session:

#Verb <<---
/opt/VirtualGL/bin/glxinfo -d glp
---

This command should output a list of visuals and complete with no errors.

*** Using GLP by Default in VirtualGL
#OPT: noList! plain!

If you wish VirtualGL to use GLP by default, then you can add

#Verb: <<---
VGL_DISPLAY=glp
export VGL_DISPLAY
---

to ''/etc/profile''.  This will cause VirtualGL to use the first device
specified in ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' as the default rendering
device.  Users can override this default by setting ''VGL_DISPLAY'' in one of
their startup scripts (such as ''~/.profile'' or ''~/.login'') or by passing an
argument of ''-d <device>'' to ''vglrun'' when invoking VirtualGL.  See
{ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_Configuration} for more details.

** Granting Access to the Server's X Display

	!!! If you plan to use VirtualGL only with [[#GLP_Usage][GLP]], then you
	can skip this section.

VirtualGL requires access to the server's 3D graphics card so that it can
create off-screen pixel buffers (Pbuffers) and redirect the 3D rendering
from applications into these Pbuffers.  Unfortunately, accessing a 3D
graphics card on Linux and Solaris/x86 systems or on Solaris/Sparc systems
without [[#GLP_Usage][GLP]] requires going through an X server.  On such
systems, the only way to share the server's 3D graphics card among multiple
users is to grant those users access to the X server that is running on the 3D
graphics card.

It is important to understand the security risks associated with this.  Once
X display access is granted to a user, there is nothing that would prevent
that user from logging keystrokes or reading back images from the X display.
Using ''xauth'', one can obtain "untrusted" X authentication keys which prevent
such exploits, but unfortunately, those untrusted keys also disallow access to
the 3D hardware.  So it is necessary to grant full trusted X access to any
users that will need to run VirtualGL.  Unless you fully trust the users to
whom you are granting this access, you should avoid logging in locally to the
server's X display as root unless absolutely necessary.

This section will explain how to configure a VirtualGL server such that
selected users can run VirtualGL, even if the server is sitting at the login
prompt.

	#. Shut down the display manager:

		Linux servers :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			init 3
			---

		Solaris servers running GDM :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			svcadm disable gdm2-login
			---

		Solaris servers running dtlogin :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			/etc/init.d/dtlogin stop
			---

	#. Log in as root from the text console (or remotely via. SSh.)

	#. Run

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglserver_config
		---

	#. Select option 1 (''Configure server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode''.)

	#. {:}

		#Verb: <<---
		Restrict local X server access to vglusers group (recommended)?
		[Y/n]
		---

		Yes :: Only users in the ''vglusers'' group can use VirtualGL (the
			configuration script will create the ''vglusers'' group if it doesn't
			already exist.)  This is the most secure option, since it prevents any
			users outside of the ''vglusers'' group from accessing (and thus
			exploiting) the VirtualGL server's X display.

		No :: VirtualGL can be used by any user that successfully logs into the
			VirtualGL server.  The X server can also be accessed (and potentially
			exploited) by any user who is logged into the VirtualGL server.  If you
			choose this option, it is recommended that you also disable the XTEST
			extension (see below.)

	#. {:}

		#Verb: <<---
		Restrict framebuffer device access to vglusers group (recommended)?
		[Y/n]
		---

		Yes :: Only users in the ''vglusers'' group can run OpenGL applications on
			the VirtualGL server (the configuration script will create the
			''vglusers'' group if it doesn't already exist.)  This limits the
			possibility that an unauthorized user could snoop the 3D framebuffer
			device(s) and thus see (or alter) the 3D output of an application running
			in VirtualGL.

		No :: Any authenticated user can run OpenGL applications on the VirtualGL
			server.  If it is necessary for users outside of the ''vglusers'' group
			to log in locally to the server and run OpenGL applications, then this
			is probably the best option.

	#. {:}

		#Verb: <<---
		Disable XTEST extension (recommended)?
		[Y/n]
		---

		Yes :: Disabling XTEST will not prevent a user from logging keystrokes or
			reading images from the X display, but if a user has access to the X
			display, disabling XTEST will prevent them from inserting keystrokes or
			mouse events and thus hijacking local X sessions on that display.

		No :: VNC requires XTEST, so if you need to attach a VNC server to the
			VirtualGL server's local X display, then it is necessary to answer "No"
			(and thus leave XTEST enabled.)

	#. If you chose to restrict X server or framebuffer device access to the
		''vglusers'' group, then edit ''/etc/group'' and add ''root'' to the
		''vglusers'' group.  If you choose, you can also add additional users to
		the group at this time.

	#. Restart the display manager:

		Linux servers :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			init 5
			---

		Solaris servers running GDM :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			svcadm enable gdm2-login
			---

		Solaris servers running dtlogin :: {:}
			#Verb: <<---
			/etc/init.d/dtlogin start
			---

*** Sanity Check
#OPT: noList! plain!

To verify that the system is ready to run VirtualGL, log out of the server,
log back into the server using SSh, and execute the following commands in the
SSh session:

	If you restricted X server access to ''vglusers'' :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	xauth merge /etc/opt/VirtualGL/vgl_xauth_key
	xdpyinfo -display :0
	/opt/VirtualGL/bin/glxinfo -display :0
	---

	!!! NOTE: ''xauth'' and ''xdpyinfo'' are in ''/usr/openwin/bin'' on Solaris
	systems.

	If you did not restrict X server access :: {:}
	#Verb <<---
	xdpyinfo -display :0
	/opt/VirtualGL/bin/glxinfo -display :0
	---

Both commands should output a list of visuals and complete with no errors.
If you chose to disable the XTEST extension, then check the output of
''xdpyinfo'' to verify that ''XTEST'' does not show up in the list of extensions.

** Device Permissions with Older NVidia Drivers

If you are installing VirtualGL on a server which is running version 1.0-71xx
or earlier of the NVidia accelerated GLX drivers, follow the instructions in
''/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/README'' regarding setting the appropriate
permissions for ''/dev/nvidia*''.  This is not necessary with more recent
versions of the driver.  ''cat /proc/driver/nvidia/version'' to determine
which version of the NVidia driver is installed on your system.

** SSh Server Configuration

The server's SSh daemon should have the ''X11Forwarding'' option enabled and
the ''UseLogin'' option disabled.  This is configured in ''sshd_config'',
the location of which varies depending on your distribution of SSh.  Linux and
Solaris 10 systems generally keep this in ''/etc/ssh'', whereas Blastwave
OpenSSh keeps it in ''/opt/csw/etc'' and SunFreeware OpenSSh keeps it in
''/usr/local/etc''.

** Un-Configuring the Server

You can use the ''vglserver_config'' script to restore the security settings
that were in place before VirtualGL was installed.  Option 2 (''Unconfigure
server for use with VirtualGL in GLX mode'') will remove any shared access to
the server's X display and thus prevent VirtualGL from accessing the 3D
hardware in that manner.  Option 2 will also re-enable the XTEST extension on
the server's X display.  Both Option 2 and Option 4 (''Unconfigure server for
use with VirtualGL in GLP mode'') will restore the framebuffer device
permissions to their default (by default, only root or the user that is
currently logged into the system locally can access the framebuffer devices.)

	!!! NOTE: Unconfiguring the server does not remove the ''vglusers'' group or
	the ''/etc/dt/config/GraphicsDevices'' file.

After selecting Option 2, you must restart the display manager before the
changes will take effect.
